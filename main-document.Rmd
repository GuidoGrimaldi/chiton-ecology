# Abstract

Biofluorescence is a widespread yet understudied phenomenon in marine benthic habitats. While the functional significance of biofluorescence has been explored in corals and some reef fishes, its ecological role for marine mollusks remains largely unknown. 
Red crust algae, rich in fluorescent pigments, commonly grow along the edges of intertidal boulders. The Western Atlantic chiton, *Ischnoplax pectinata*, is a biofluorescent mollusk frequently found beneath boulders in intertidal reefs of  northeastern Brazil. This suggest a  potential ecological link between these organisms. In this study, we investigated whether the coverage of fluorescent substrates on the sides of boulders influences the abundance of *I. pectinata* along intertidal boulder reefs. Using field surveys across multiple reefs, we quantified chiton abundance and the cover of both fluorescent and non-fluorescent substrates on the sides of different boulders. Our results reveal a positive association between the abundance of *I. pectinata* and the coverage of fluorescent red crust algae, particularly on vertical boulders surfaces. This pattern suggests a potential role for photic cues in microhabitat use, possibly mediated by food preference, camouflage, or attraction to fluorescence. Future research should incorporate behavioral experiments and spectral measurements to test how chitons perceive and respond to fluorescence under natural light conditions. By highlighting a novel link between substrate fluorescence and chitons distribution, this study opens new avenues for understanding the sensory ecology of benthic invertebrates and its implications for reef biodiversity.

# Introduction

Fluorescence is a natural physical process in which light absorbed at shorter wavelengths — typically in the ultraviolet or blue region — is re-emitted at longer wavelengths by fluorescent pigments known as fluorophores [@matz2006c; @taboada2017a; @protzel2021]. This process alters the spectral distribution of the emitted light, producing distinct optical signatures (or "colors", to human vision)  that differ fundamentally from those generated by reflection or scattering [@johnsen2011]. Although fluorescence does not add energy to a system, it can enhance surface brightness by increasing photon output [@arnold2002; @mazel2004; @lim2007]. In biological systems, biofluorescence is taxonomically widespread, occurring across a diverse range of organisms from  both terrestrial and marine ecosystems [@sparks2014c; @macel2020; @carr2025]. Its broad distribution across taxa and environments suggests potential significance as a biological, ecological, and evolutionary trait [@whitcher2024a; @martin2025]. 


Despite being a common trait, the ecological and evolutionary functions of fluorescence remain incompletely understood [@iriel2010; @marshall2017; @whitcher2024]. Various hypothesis have been proposed, including communication [@meadows2014; @kalb2015; @whitcher2024a], prey and pollinator attraction [@thorp1975; @gandia-herrero2005; @kurup2013; @haddock2015], symbiont recruitment [@aihara2019], camouflage [@wucherer2014; @gruber2016d; @debrauwer2016c], mate attraction [@pearn2001; @arnold2002], and enhancement of visual contrast in structurally complex or dim light environments [@bitton2017; @protzel2021]. These functions vary among species and habitat, reflecting the diversity of ecological contexts in which fluorescence occurs. In marine systems fluorescence, especially the red one, appears to be widespread among cryptobenthic animals [@anthes2016; @harant2017; @michiels2018; @park2019].  However, the ecological consequences of fluorescence in benthic organisms, especially those inhabiting heterogeneous substrates, remain largely unexplored.


Intertidal and shallow subtidal reefs are dynamic habitats characterized by rapid changes in light availability and quality due to tidal cycles, water movement, depth, and the structural complexity of the substrate and overlying algal canopy [@cuthill2019; @nilsson2022]. This dynamic creates a complex of light conditions that can influence how organisms perceive and interact with their surroundings [@matchette2018; @matchette2020]. In such environments, visual cues play a key role in habitat selection, spatial navigation, communication and species interactions [@attwell2021; @drerup2024]. For benthic organisms in particular, which often depend on close contact with the substrate for protection, feeding, and reproduction, the ability to detect and respond to visual cues in their immediate environment can strongly influence patterns of microhabitat use and species distribution [@mason2011; @matsumura2014; @sumner-rooney2021].


Chitons, or polyplacophorans, are a group of marine mollusks known for their slow movement and strong association with hard substrates [@eernisse2007; @parkhaev2017]. They possess an eight-plate shell equipped with various sensory receptors that are highly sensitive to light [@li2015; @liu2022b]. Some species even have specialized '*shell eyes*' capable of image formation and polarization vision [@speiser2011; @speiser2014; @kingston2018; @chappell2023]. This sensory-integrated armor likely contributed to their survival through  major climate changes and transformation of the  Earth’s surface over geological time [@wanninger2019]. Many chiton species are strongly associated with calcareous red algae [@steneck1986; @littler1995], which contain high concentrations of fluorescent pigments in their tissue [@glazer1994]. In boulder reef, red crustose algae are abundant along the edges of intertidal boulders [@liversage2016], where  chiton species are often observed crawling and feeding on the side surfaces [@yoshioka2006; @aguilera2012]. However, the chiton *Ischnoplax pectinata* (G. B. Sowerby II, 1840) stands apart from the most other species, as its shells exhibit fluorescence when exposed to narrow light spectra [@grimaldi2023], suggesting a potential link between organism and habitat fluorescence that warrants investigation.


Despite growing interest in biofluorescence, few studies have addressed how fluorescent substrates influence habitat selection and distribution patterns of benthic invertebrates [@matsumura2014]. In particular, the relationship between fluorescent backgrounds and the distribution of biofluorescent chitons in intertidal reef environments remains poorly understood. This study aims to fill this gap by exploring whether the coverage of fluorescent substrates on the sides of boulders influences the abundance of the fluorescent chiton *I. pectinata* along intertidal boulder reefs. We hypothesize that: (1) boulders with a higher percentage of fluorescent substrate cover on their side surfaces will host a greater abundance of chitons, and (2) this effect is not driven by a specific species of encrusting algae, but consistent across all fluorescent substrates.


# Material and Methods

## Study site

This study was conducted in the boulder regions of four intertidal reefs spanning approximately 90 km along the eastern coast of Rio Grande do Norte, northeastern Brazil: Baía Formosa (06°22’S 34°59’W), Búzios (06°00’S 35°06’W),  Pitangui (05°37’S 35°13’W), and Santa Rita (05°41’S 35°11’W). The region experiences  a tropical humid climate, with a distinct dry season runs from October to December and a rainy season extending from February to September [@diniz2015; @vital2016]. Tidal cycles are semi-diurnal and follow a meso-tidal regime [@vital2016]. 


## Field Methods/ Data Collection

Sampling was conducted during low tide between April and May 2021, encompassing a total of 120 boulders (30 per reef). Prior to sampling, a preliminary nighttime snorkeling survey was conducted to assess the presence of fluorescent substrates on the side  surfaces of boulders. This fluorescence was visually evaluated using a short-wavelength (~450 nm) flashlight equipped with a long-pass filter (BW-1 Dive Light, NIGHTSEA Llc.). Among the substrates observed, only the red crust algae *Lithothamnium* sp. and *Peyssonnelia* sp. exhibited visible fluorescence. Additionally, each site was surveyed to confirm the presence of the chiton *I. pectinata* in the sampling area. This species is readily identifiable among Brazilian chitons by its relatively large size (up to ~45 mm in length) and elongate body shape [@junior1985]. 


Once the species was confirmed, a random sampling direction was determined using a digital stopwatch, following the method of @gotelli2012: North (odd/odd), East (odd/even), South (even/even), or West (even/odd). We then walked 15 steps in the chosen direction and selected the nearest accessible unstable boulder (*i.e.* that could be overturned without being buried or trapped), a key habitat characteristic for boulder-dwelling chitons species [@palmer2012; @lima2019]. A second stopwatch draw determined whether to sample the selected boulder. If the result  was negative or if the site fell outside the sampling boulder region area, the process was repeated. 


Boulders were selected regardless of weight, provided they could be safety overturned [@palmer2012]. At each boulder, we recorded the abundance of attached *I. pectinata*  individuals (count, ‘*Chitons*’), water temperature (°C, ‘*Temp*’), tide level relative to the boulder’s base (cm, ‘*Wt.level*’), and the boulder weight (kg, ‘*Weight*’). Photographs were taken of the underside and all sides of each boulder, with a scale for reference. Boulder weight was measured using a handheld scale and cloth bag, with weighing conducted last to minimize potential disturbance to the chiton counts. All boulders were georeferenced and treated as independent habitat unit [@palmer2012]. After sampling, each boulder was carefully returned to its original position and orientation.


Images were analyzed using PhotoQuad software [@trygonis2012]. Following image calibration, a region of interest (ROI) was manually defined for each side of every boulder to measure the total surface area (‘*Boulder.area*’) and the exposed area (‘*Expo.area*’), corresponding to regions not covered by the macroalgae canopy. Within the ROI of the exposed area, 70 stratified random points (marker: circle, size: 10, width: 2) were generated to quantify substrate cover. Each point was classified into one of the following substrate categories: "hard" red crust algae (CCA, *Lithothamnium* sp.), “soft” red crust algae (*Peyssonnelia* sp.), dead red crusts (which includes both types of red algae), ascidians, bryozoans, cnidarians, polychaets, mollusks, sponges, bare rock, holes, microbial mats, and unidentifiable substrates. While some *Peyssonnelia* species possess partially calcified cell walls, they lack the substantial calcium carbonate deposits characteristic of true crustose coralline algae (CCA). This gives them a softer and more flexible texture compared to the rigid structure of heavily calcified red algae [@guimaraes1999].


## Statistical Analysis

We organized our dataset into ten explanatory variables. Fluorescent substrates (‘*Flu.cover*’) included living cover of "hard" (‘*Live.cca*’) and "soft" (‘*Live.pey*’) red crust algae. Non-fluorescent substrates (‘*Unflu.cover*’) comprised the cover of dead red crusts (‘*Dead.red.crust*’) and other non-fluorescent components (‘*Unflu.others*’), such as bare rock and microbial mats. Additional substrate categories included ascidian cover (‘*Asc.cover*’), bryozoan cover (‘*Bryo.cover*’), sponge cover (‘*Spong.cover*’), and a grouped category (‘*Others*’) including holes and unidentifiable substrates.


A data exploration analysis was conducted following the protocol of @zuur2010 (see Supplementary Material A). To assess differences among reefs, we used the Kruskal-Wallis test (hereafter as KW test), followed by Dunn’s *post-hoc* test with Bonferroni correction. Correlations among variables were evaluated using Kendall’s tau coefficient. To minimize multicollinearity, Variance Inflation Factor (VIFs) were calculated, and the variable ‘*Unflu.cover*’ was excluded to ensure all VIF values remained below 2 [@zuur2010].


For model building, we opted for a top-down selection strategy [@west2022]. An initial full model was fitted, excluding cnidarian, polychaete, and mollusk variables due to their low cumulative cover (<1%). Given that site-level effect was not the objective of our study, we considered including '*Site*' as a random factor. The model was then simplified by  sequentially removing non-significant fixed effects (p ≥ 0.05), retaining only those variables essential for maintaining the model’s optimal fit [@zuur2011, see Supplementary Material B]. 


Model selection was based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), with a decrease in ΔBIC ≥1 interpreted as a substantial improvement in model performance [@burnham2002]. Bayesian model weights (ranging from 0 to 1) were calculated to evaluate the relative plausibility of each candidate model. Nested models were compared using likelihood ratio test via ANOVA, incorporating corrections for testing on the boundary as recommended by @zuur2011. 


Following model selection, scaled residuals were computed and assessed for deviations from uniformity through visual inspection and formal goodness-of-fit test using simulated residuals in the ‘DHARMa’ package [@hartig2022]. To evaluate whether the abundance of chitons ('*Chitons*') was associated with fluorescent substrate coverage ('*Flu.cover*') on boulder sides, we fitted a zero-inflated Poisson generalized linear mixed model (ziGLMM Poisson), including ‘*Sites*’ as a random effect. A square root transformation was applied to the predictor to improve the model fit


To further explore whether the observed effect reflected a species-specific relationship with distinct types of red crust algae ("hard" or "soft"), we constructed an alternative model using ‘*Live.cca*’ and ‘*Live.pey*’ as separate predictors. The final selected model was a zero-inflated Negative Binomial GLMM (ziGLMM Negative Binomial), which best accommodated overdispersion in the data. All statistical analyses were conducted in R (R Development Core Team, 2024), with GLMM models fitted using the glmmTMB package [@brooks2017].


# Results

## General characterization and comparison among reefs

A total of 137 chitons were recorded, with adults comprising 95.6% (n=131) of the regional population. Juvenile chitons, 1°-5° developmental stage (Jardim, 2015), accounted for 4.4% (n=6), resulting in a ratio of one juvenile every 20 adults. Chitons occupied 36.6% (n=44) of the boulders sampled, with an encounter rate of approximately nine chitons per hour. During sampling, only eight individuals were observed active on the side of the boulders. At the reef scale, Búzios exhibited a significantly higher abundance of *I. pectinata* compared to the other sites (p<0.01, KW test), with an average density of 3.60 individuals per boulder (Table 1). This site also showed the highest levels of individual aggregation, with up to 15 chitons recorded on a single boulder, whereas in the other reefs, no boulder harbored more than three individuals. Significant variation was observed in water levels (mean $\pm$ SD: 37.9 $\pm$ 31.8 cm, p<0.01, KW test) and water temperature (30.7 $\pm$ 1.5 °C, p<0.01, KW test). The boulders had an average weight of 7.0 $\pm$ 6.3 kg, ranging from 1.5 to 25 kg, with no significant weight differences across reefs (p=0.53, KW test). Similarly, estimated surfaces areas showed consistent values across reefs (267 $\pm$ 144 cm^2^, p=0.70, KW test).

TABLE 1

The exposed surface area of the boulder sides averaged 222 $\pm$ 121 cm^2^, with a range of 60.78 to 698.36 cm^2^. No significant differences were observed among reefs (p=0.44, KW test). On average, the exposed side surfaces consisted of 54.11 $\pm$ 20.19% fluorescent substrates, 31.83 $\pm$ 18.29% non-fluorescent substrates, 12.10 $\pm$ 12.07% animal coverage, and 1.96 $\pm$ 2.45% other components. Red-crusted algae were consistently present on the side faces of all sampled boulders, accounting 47.52 $\pm$ 21.39% crustose coralline algae (*Lithothamnium* sp.) and 6.59 $\pm$ 12.50% soft red-crusted algae (*Peyssonnelia* sp.). Despite their lower coverage, soft red crusts were found on 66% of the boulder’s side faces (Supplementary Material A). Animal coverage was primarily composed of ascidians (5.79 $\pm$ 7.78%), sponges (2.83 $\pm$ 4.85%), and bryozoans (1.54 $\pm$ 4.14%). Among these, only bryozoans showed no significant differences among reefs (Table 2).


## Chitons abundance increases with fluorescent and bryozoans covers

Our best model reveals that chiton abundance significantly increases with higher percentages of fluorescent substrate on the sides of the boulders, regardless of reef characteristics (Table 3). Specifically, chiton’s abundance increases at a rate of 0.02 chitons per percentage of fluorescent substrates (ziGLMM Poisson, z=3.11, SE=0.01, p=0.002, Figure 2). The square root of bryozoan cover was essential for maintaining the structure of the best-fitted model. However, its influence on chitons was interpreted with parsimony, as it was close to the significance threshold (ziGLMM Poisson, z=1.96, SE=0.11, p=0.049).


When assessing the species-specific relationship between chitons and red crust algae, algal cover did not predict a higher likelihood of chiton abundance on boulders. Instead, bryozoan cover emerged as the key predictor, showing a proportional linear increase in chiton abundance as bryozoan cover expanded on the boulder sides (Tabela 2). This relationship corresponds to a growth rate of 0.06 chitons per percentage increase of bryozoan cover (GLMM Negative Binomial, z=2.28, SE=0.03, p=0.022).


# Discussion

Our findings reveal that the abundance of the biofluorescent chiton *Ischnoplax pectinata* increases significantly with the coverage of fluorescent substrates on the sides of intertidal boulders, suggesting that fluorescence of red crust algae may serve as a visual cue to guiding microhabitat selection or site fidelity. This relationship remained robust across reef sites and was not driven by a particular species of red crust algae, supporting the hypothesis that chitons respond to the general presence of fluorescent surfaces rather than to species-specific algal traits. Unexpectedly, when substrate types were analyzed separately, bryozoan cover emerged as a significantly predictor of chiton abundance, indicating that not-fluorescent biological components of substrate may also influence habitat preferences, either independently or in combination with fluorescence.  Together, these results suggest that *I. pectinata* responds to a complex suite of benthic cues, with visual signals likely playing an important, but not exclusive, role in determining its spatial distribution.


Previous studies on boulder-chitons species have also shown non-random distribution patterns, often characterized by strong aggregation on a limited number of available boulders [@chapman1996; @chapman2002; @liversage2013]. In most cases, the majority of boulders remain unoccupied while several individuals clustered on just a few [@grayson2004], However, patterns appear to vary among species and habitat [@liversage2013; @mendonca2015]. Based on a genetic study, @palmer2012 demonstrated that these aggregations are not genetically structured, as new individuals contribute to genetic diversity within the population [@palmer2012]. This is notable, as such clustering could be expected to increase intraspecific competition for space or food resources [@chelazzi1983]. It remains unclear whether these aggregations are primarily driven by the availability of food, by social behavior such attraction to conspecifics, or by specific habitat characteristics such geological rock type, boulder shape, and their spatial arrangement [@takada1999; @lehir2005]. Similar aggregation behavior observed in intertidal gastropods has been interpreted as a strategy to reduce desiccation stress [@levings1983] or to reduce the effects of wave action [@feare1971]. Although we did not explicitly assess wave action disturbance regime in this study, aggregation of *I. pectinata* was only found at the Búzios reef, a site with water column height and potentially higher exposure to wave actions.


It is possible that the biofluorescence observed in the shell of *I. pectinata* originates from a diet rich in red crust algae. Many studies have reported the presence of fleshy and coralline red algae in the gut content of several chiton species [@demopulos1975; @nishi1975; @piercy1987; @camus2012], indicating a mutualistic relationship in which chiton grazing may enhance algal biomass [@littler1995]. These algae often contain important fluorescent pigments such as chlorophyll a and carotenoids, that may be incorporated into the shell structure during biomineralization [@wolf1967; @peebles2017]. Particularly, carotenoids are known to be widespread fluorophore in both invertebrates and vertebrate [@lagorio2015; @williams2016], including in many chiton species [@tushima1989; @peebles2017]. However, not all organisms are biofluorescent, the fluorescence properties of fluorophores are influenced by  intrinsic factors (*e.g.* conjugation length, functional groups) and environments conditions such as solvent polarity, colored dissolved organic matter [@mazel2017; @chen2018]. Despite these potential links, establishing a direct pathway between red algae consumption and chiton shell fluorescence is challenging, given that chiton are commonly generalist omnivores [@sigwart2017]. Though their radula, a muscular belt-like strap equipped with rows of iron oxide-mineralized teeth [@joester2016], chitons ingest plant and animal materials indiscriminately (the most part sediments), a process commonly referred to as ‘*bulldozing*’ [@fulton1975; @langer1983; @smith1997a; @liversage2019] . 


Another plausible explanation underlying the observed association between *I. pectinata* and fluorescent substrates is that larval settlement may be guided by a combination of chemical and visual cues operating at different spatial scales. Over longer distances, chiton planktonic larvae (*i.e.* trochophores) may rely on waterborne chemical cues released by red crust algae to detect suitable habitats, a mechanism observed to crustose coralline algae [@barnes1973; @rumrill1983]. As trochophore larvae approach the substrate, however, the enhanced surface brightness generated by algal fluorescence under specific condition could provide a short-range visual cue that facilitates microhabitat selection and settlement, such as demonstrated to barnacle larvae [@matsumura2014]. This multimodal sensorial strategy may be particularly advantageous in complex intertidal environments, where patch quality can vary in many aspects over small spatial-temporal scales [@cuthill2019; @matchette2020].


Bryozoans are common components of boulder-dwelling communities and often engage in intense competition with other encrusting organisms, such as ascidians, sponges, and hydroids, for limited space on hard substrates. Interestingly, like chiton larvae, some bryozoan larvae possess ciliary eyespots that respond positively to light cues, suggesting that phototactic mechanisms may influence their settlement during early developmental stages [@randel2016]. Several chiton species have been reported with bryozoan colonies encrusted on their shells [@sigwart2009; @alvarez-cerrillo2021], and bryozoan fragments are frequently found, albeit in small quantities, in their stomach contents [@gordon1972; @nishi1975; @piercy1987; @byrnes2009; @sigwart2017]. However, it remains unclear whether bryozoans are intentionally consumed or are ingested incidentally through '*bulldozing*', while foraging for smaller organisms such as diatoms, amphipods, or copepods that inhabit or are associated with bryozoan colonies [@osman1981; @lidgard2008]. Our findings reveal a positive association between the abundance of *I. pectinata* and bryozoan cover on the sides of intertidal boulders, even though bryozoans were present at relatively low coverage across all reefs. This suggests that bryozoans may play a previously overlooked role in the spatial distribution of this chiton species.


This study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, its observational design limits our ability to infer causality from detected patterns. For example, it remains unclear whether this positive correlation between red crust algae and chiton abundance is driven by food availability, visual camouflage or other correlated factors. An experimental design to direct test isolating fluorescence would be necessary to draw firmer conclusions. Second, the spatial and temporal scope of the study was restricted, focusing on a limited number of reefs during a narrow time window, which may not fully capture the variability in environmental conditions or species behavior. Additionally, unmeasured factors such as hydrodynamic, wave-action, predation, migration, or competition could have influenced chitons distribution nut were not accounted for in our analyses. Finally, fluorescence was not quantified under natural environmental light conditions, and no behavioral experiments were conducted to directly test chiton response to fluorescence cues. These limitations highlight the need for complementary experimental studies and broader spatial-temporal sampling to better understand the ecological role of fluorescence substrates. 


Future research should build on our findings through experimental designs that directly test whether  *I. pectinata* can detect and preferentially respond to fluorescent substrates. Behavioral assays under controlled light conditions would be particularly valuable in clarifying whether fluorescence functions as a visual cue for habitat selection. Expanding surveys to include non-fluorescence chiton species could also provide comparative insights into the ecological relevance of fluorescence across taxa. In addition, incorporating spectral reflectance data from chitons shells and red crust algal backgrounds, along with measurements of the environmental light condition, would
help refine our understanding of how fluorescence is perceived *in situ*, including  by potential chiton predators. Spectrochemical analyses of chiton shells and gut content studies could also reveal whether dietary intakes are influenced by interaction with algal fluorescence. Finally, in a broader ecological context, future studies should explore how shifts in algal community composition driven by climate changes may alter the availability of fluorescent habitats, with potential consequences for biofluorescent chitons populations and overall reef biodiversity. 


In conclusion, our findings reveal that *I. pectinata* exhibits increased abundance on fluorescent substrates, suggesting possibly role of visual ecology in its habitat selection. This study is among the first to propose a link between the spatial distribution of a chiton species and substrates fluorescence, highlighting a novel and understudied aspect of benthic invertebrate ecology. While further research is needed to determine whether this association is drive by phototactic attraction, camouflage or dietary preference, our results open new avenues for exploring how benthic organisms may perceive and respond to fluorescent cues in their environment. Understanding these sensory-drive selections is especially relevant to assessing the resilience of intertidal communities in an era of rapid environmental change.
