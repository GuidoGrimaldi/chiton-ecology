# Abstract

Boulder reefs are dynamic ecosystems characterized by their structural complexity and diversity communities of specialist species. Boulder dwellers organisms rely on sensory cues to evaluate habitat quality, particularly during critical processes such as larval settlement and adult dispersion. While research on boulder reefs has predominantly focused on the upper and lower surfaces of boulders, the ecological dynamics of the boulder sides remain understudied. The Western Atlantic chiton, *Ischnoplax pectinata*, is a biofluorescent mollusk commonly found beneath intertidal boulders in northeastern Brazil. These chitons exhibit three-dimensional movement on a boulder habitat, emerging at specific times to feed on the boulder sides. Red crust algae, commonly found along the edges of intertidal boulders, are rich in fluorescent pigments, suggesting a potential ecological link to chiton behavior and distribution. This study investigated whether chiton abundance correlates with the percentage of fluorescent substrate coverage on boulder sides and whether this relation is influenced by a species-specific effect of red crust algae, using statistical models to analyze field data. Results showed a positive association between chiton abundance and fluorescent substrate coverage, with bryozoan cover emerging as a critical stabilizing predictor. In models specifically assessing red crust algae, bryozoans were identified as the primary predictor of chiton abundance, suggesting a complementary ecological role. These findings support the hypothesis that the relationship between *I. pectinata* and red crust algae extends beyond a simple trophic interaction, involving visual and behavioral dynamics influenced by fluorescence. Understanding the ecological significance of fluorescence provides valuable insights into how visual environmental cues shape species interactions and ecosystem structure. This research underscores the importance of conserving rocky reef ecosystems to ensure their resilience and functional integrity amid global environmental change. By exploring these connections, researchers can uncover how climate-induced disruptions shape the structure and resilience of coastal reef ecosystems, offering guidance for their conservation in an era of rapid climatic changes.

# Introduction

Coastal reefs are facing unprecedented Anthropogenic driven threats to their continued existence as biodiverse and functional ecosystems upon which hundreds of millions of people rely [@hughes2017]. These include well-known systems like coral reefs, rocky shores, and seagrasses, along with lesser-known habitats such as rhodolith beds, sandstone reef, boulder fields, and others [@soares2017; @tucker2017; @schubert2025]. Boulder fields, also known as boulder reefs, are lesser-known marine ecosystems that harbor biodiverse communities, including rare and habitat-specialist species. These systems are globally distributed across coastal and littoral zones in temperate and tropical regions [@liversage2018a] and have served as foundation ecosystems for the development of our ecological theories, particularly those related to predation, competition and disturbance [@connell1961; @paine1969; @menge1972; @sousa1979a]. A boulder, in geological terms, refers to a detached rock fragment (i.e. piece of stone) larger than 256 mm, regardless of its shape [@wentworth1922]. When submerged in natural aquatic environments, these loose rock fragments often become colonized by sessile benthic organisms [@wilson1987]. This holds ecological significance for two main reasons. First, in aquatic ecosystems, hard substrates are a limited resource for encrusting and boring organisms, leading to space competition [@barnes2003]. Second, individual boulders serve as discrete, measurable unit for study [@sousa1979]. Moreover, their mobility allows them to be overturned by weather events, causing disturbance within their associated communities [@sousa1979a; @mcguinness1987a; @li2023]. Evidence of this disturbance process can even be detectable in the fossil record [@surlyk1974; @wilson1985]. In intertidal zones, disturbances may arise from wave action [@sousa1979a], currents and storms [@li2023], and human activities [@stagnol2013]. Additionally, microscale disturbance can result from wave-borne projectiles (e.g. logs, driftwood, pebbles, cobbles and even other boulders), as well as sand abrasion or ice scour [@daly1977; @shanks1986; @barnes2001]. The rate of boulder overturning depends on factors such as size, mass, shape, burial, orientation, and location [@mcguinness1987a; @lorang2000; @goto2010; @gomez-pazo2021]. Consequently, the disturbance frequency, combined with the intrinsic characteristics of boulders, leads to boulder reefs being spatially arranged as a mosaic of patches at different stages of community development over [@osman1977; @sousa1984; @mcguinness1986]. This creates a highly dynamic, patchy, and unstable marine ecosystem.


An organism is intrinsically integrated to its environment, continuously interacting with its physical and chemical properties (Maturana and Varela, 1987). These properties can be observed as cues and signals, which organisms use as sources of information to establish ecological relationships and adapt to a changing world (Stevens, 2013; Delhey and Peters, 2017). These interactions are primarily mediated by the sensory system, which delineates the organism's sensory environments (Krapp and Wicklein, 2008) and, ultimately, its ecological niche (Jaeger, 1978). At a finer scale, factors such as resource availability, reproductive needs, competition, predation risk, and disturbance regime act as filters, shaping behaviors that enable individuals to select high-quality habitats for survival and reproduction (Kimirei et al., 2013; Majoris et al, 2018; Hyman et al, 2024). These patterns of habitat use define, at broader scales, the critical areas necessary for the population's long-term survival and reproduction, leading to spatial-temporal heterogeneity observed at the community level (Rosenzweig1987; DeAngelis and Grimm, 2014; Leibold and Chase 2018). In patchy landscapes such as boulder reefs, habitat specialist organisms often select environments that maximize their fitness (Price, 2010; Rimmer et al., 2021). Boulder dwellers species are particularly influenced by their ability to use sensory cues to evaluate habitat quality, especially during processes like larval settlement or spatial distribution (Silén and Jansson, 1972; Svane and Dolmer, 1995; Sumner-Rooney et al., 2020). Studies on larval settlement have shown that the spectral characteristics and brightness of substrates positively influence habitat selection in photosensitive planktonic larvae of various benthic invertebrate species (Satheesh and Wesley 2010; Mason et al., 2011; Ells et al., 2016). As many shallow-water marine organisms are light-sensitive during at least one phase of their life cycle (Cronin et al., 2017), light plays a pivotal role in the bioecology of these species (Marshall, 2017).


Light is the driving force behind most ecosystems, playing a fundamental role in essential biological processes such as photosynthesis, photoperiodism, biological rhythms, phototaxis, and vision [@bjorn2015; @bhadra2017; @brelsford2019]. It influences specie distribution, productivity, and ecological interactions [@floder2002; @cohen2002; @thrane2014], while acting as a selective pressure that drives evolutionary changes in behaviors, physiology, and morphology [@lahti2016; @rapf2016; @beckstead2016]. Its availability and effective utilization by living organisms depend on how it interacts with matter [@brandbury2011]. For instance, the amount (i.e. photons number) and quality (i.e. wavelength or frequency) of sunlight reaching the seafloor are influenced by factors such as depth, sun position, phytoplankton concentration, suspended sediment, and dissolved organic matter (Nilsson et al., 2022). Similarly, the quality of light reaching visual pigments is shaped by the optical properties of pre-retinal media (e.g. cornea, lens, and humors) and specialized structures like oil droplets and tapeta [@cronin2014]. This interaction gives rise to an extraordinary diversity of color patterns in nature, functioning as visual signals for sociosexual communication [@kato2024], camouflage [@cuthill2019a], and aposematism [@caro2019a], as well as visual cues for shelter-seeking [@costa2023], foraging [@spaethe2001], and conspecific recognition [@silva2024]. These color patterns emerge from contrasts between color patches, primarily generated by three mechanisms: 1) selective absorption by pigments, 2) light reflection from structural mechanisms in the integument (i.e., structural colors), and 3) self-generated light through biochemical processes, known as bioluminescence [@cuthill2017; @schramm2024]. Within the first mechanism, fluorescent pigments (i.e., fluorophores) have attracted particular attention due to the growing number of documented biofluorescent animals, including sponges [@read1968; @mazel2003b], corals [@eyal2015], hydrozoans [@maggioni2020], siphonophores [@haddock2015], planarians [@stubenhaus2016], worms [@mazel2003b], chitons [@ramesh2021; @grimaldi2023], bivalves [@miyoshi1987; @wanamaker2009], seasnails [@williams2016], nudibranchs [@betti2021a], barnacles [@matsumura2014], crabs [@juhasz-dora2024], stomatopds [@mazel2004], tardigrades [@suma2020], insects [@welch2012; @messenger2019], spiders [@lim2007; @brandt2017], fish [@anthes2016; @sparks2014a], frogs [@taboada2017a], salamanders [@lamb2020a], turtles [@gruber2015a], geckos [@protzel2021], birds [@arnold2002; @wilkinson2019], and mammals [@olson2021a; @anich2021]. Fluorescent pigments can transfer energy across the optical spectrum, altering their spectral characteristics (i.e. color). As a result, light emitted by a fluorescent surface or pigment typically has lower energy (i.e., longer wavelength) than absorbed light [@johnsen2011]. While this does not introduce additional energy into the systems, fluorophores can increase photon output, potentially enhancing the brightness of an organism's surface [@mazel2004; @montgomerie2006]. However, the ecological and evolutionary role of biofluorescence remains debated [@iriel2010; @marshall2017; @mazel2017], with some studies suggesting that fluorescence may amplify visual signals [@whitcher2024], potentially influencing mate choice [@arnold2002; @mazel2004; @lim2007] and settlement of planktonic larvae of marine benthic organisms [@matsumura2014]. 


Chitons are multi-shelled mollusks that are strongly associated with hard marine substrates [@eernisse2007]. Their most remarkable feature is their eight-plate shell, equipped with various sensory receptors that are highly sensitive to light [@liu2022]. Some species even possess specialized 'shell eyes' capable of image formation and polarization vision [@speiser2011; @li2015; @chappell2023]. This sensory-integrated armor, shared by all modern chitons (dating back to the early Carboniferous ca. 340 Mya), closely resembles that of plate-bearing ancestral species from the early Cambrian ca. 540 Mya [@sigwart2009; @parkhaev2017]. This adaptation likely enabled chitons to survive major climate changes and Earth’s surface transformation throughout history [@wanninger2019], allowing them to inhabit a diverse range of environments today, from coastal areas to deep seas [@kangas1984; @schwabe2004; Konar et al., 2006; Saito et al., 2008; Barros et al., 2013; Reyes-Gómez et al., 2017; Sigwart, 2017; Barboza, 2019). Chitons also possess an iron-mineralized radula, which is use to scrape food from the substrates, ingesting various organisms and sediment particles [@fulton1975; @joester2016]. Consequently, many intertidal species can digest both plant and animal material, making them browsing omnivorous [@latyshev2004; @sigwart2017]. Ecologically, chitons play a role in regulating algal growth through grazing, while also unintentionally impact community diversity by creating a “bulldozing-effect” on larvae and post-metamorphic invertebrate stages, influencing community structure and composition [@aguilera2007; @aguilera2012; @aguilera2015; @liversage2019]. Boulder chitons are habitat specialist species that fully utilize the three-dimensional structure of their habitat [@liversage2017a]. Their behavior is influenced by both tidal and non-tidal rhythms, including the light-dark cycle, tidal regime, seasonal changes, climate and temperature variations, habitat features, food availability, and interactions with other species [@glynn1970; @kangas1984; @yoshioka2006; @ng2006]. These factors contribute to behavioral diversity across habitats and species [@cretchley1997].


Chitons are closely associated with red crust algae [@steneck1982a], relying on coralline crustose as a primary food source [@piercy1987; @littler1995; @camus2012] and larval settling surface [@barnes1973; @rumrill1983; @figueiredo1997;@roberts2010; @ritson-williams2014]. Red algae are easily recognized by their reddish hue, which primarily results from accessory pigments known as phycobilins [@lee2018]. These phycobiliproteins are highly fluorescent components of light-harvesting photosynthetic antenna complexes [@glazer1994]. In oceanic habitats, wavelength-dependent absorption by water causes the broad-spectrum sunlight at the surface to narrow with increasing depth, shifting the ambient light spectrum toward blue [@cronin2014]. This environment condition favors fluorescence by providing suitable light to induce it while also enhancing potential visual functions [@anthes2016; @meadows2014]. Similarly, intertidal habitats may also experience a narrow "blue" light spectrum during twilight [@cronin2014]. A recent study has shown that the twilight spectrum plays an important role in anurans communication through biofluorescent signals in anurans [@whitcher2024a]. Many intertidal boulder chitons species are active during twilight, emerging at dawn or dusk to forage along the vertical surfaces [@langer1978]. The chiton *Ischnoplax pectinata* (G. B. Sowerby II, 1840) has an exclusive distribution in the Western Atlantic, ranging in depth from 0 to 55 meters [@gomes2015]. Limited knowledge exists regarding its ecology and behavior, but the specie is commonly found in intertidal rocky reefs, specifically underneath loose boulders during low tide. Apparently, the species exhibits fluorescence in its shell plates when artificially exposed to narrow light spectra [@grimaldi2023]. 


Most studies on the spatial distribution of boulder chitons have focused on the upper and lower surfaces of boulders [@evans1951; @kangas1984; @smith1997; @grayson2004; @mcclintock2007; @chapman2012; @liversage2017a]. In boulder habitats, red crust algae typically grow around boulders edge [@liversage2016]. This has led to the hypothesis that the chiton species I. pectinata may be more abundant on boulders with higher fluorescent coverage along the sides, which could provide both a food source and a visual background for camouflage against visually guided predators [@sigwart2018]. In this study, we investigate whether the coverage of fluorescent substrates, specifically red crust algae, on the sides of boulders influences the spatial distribution of the biofluorescent chiton *I. pectinata*. Our hypotheses are: 1) boulders with a higher percentage of fluorescent substrate coverage on their side surfaces will have a greater abundance of chitons, and 2) this relationship is not influenced by a species-specific effect of the red crust algae.


# Material and Methods

## Study site

This study was conducted in the boulder regions of four intertidal reefs spanning approximately 90 km along the eastern coast of Rio Grande do Norte, northeastern Brazil: Baía Formosa (06°22’S 34°59’W), Búzios (06°00’S 35°06’W),  Pitangui (05°37’S 35°13’W), and Santa Rita (05°41’S 35°11’W). The region experiences  a tropical humid climate, with a distinct dry season runs from October to December and a rainy season extending from February to September [@diniz2015; @vital2016]. Tidal cycles are semi-diurnal and follow a meso-tidal regime [@vital2016]. 


## Field Methods/ Data Collection

Sampling was conducted during low tide between April and May 2021, encompassing a total of 120 boulders (30 per reef). Prior to sampling, a preliminary survey was carried out at each site to confirm the presence of the chiton *Ischnoplax pectinata* within the sampling area. Among Brazilian chitons, this species is readily identifiable by its relatively large size (up to ~45 mm in length) and elongate body shape [@junior1985]. In northeastern Brazil, *I. pectinata* is a relatively common species, with adults typically found beneath unstable boulders [@lima2019]. 


Once the species was confirmed, a random sampling direction was determined using a digital stopwatch, following the method of @gotelli2012: North (odd/odd), East (odd/even), South (even/even), or West (even/odd). We then walked 15 steps in the chosen direction and selected the nearest accessible unstable boulder - that could be overturned without being buried or trapped - a key habitat characteristic for boulder-dwelling chitons species [@palmer 2012]. A second stopwatch draw determined whether to sample the selected boulder. If the result  was negative or if the site fell outside the sampling boulder region area, the process was repeated. 


Boulders were selected regardless of weight, provided they could be safety overturned [@palmer2012]. At each boulder, we recorded the abundance of attached *I. pectinata*  individuals (count, ‘*Chitons*’), water temperature (°C, ‘*Temp*’), tide level relative to the boulder’s base (cm, ‘*Wt.level*’), and the boulder weight (kg, ‘*Weight*’). Photographs were taken of the underside and all sides of each boulder, with a scale for reference. Boulder weight was measured using a handheld scale and cloth bag, with weighing conducted last to minimize potential disturbance to the chiton counts. All boulders were georeferenced and treated as independent habitat unit [@palmer2012]. After sampling, each boulder was carefully returned to its original position and orientation.


Images were analyzed using PhotoQuad software [@trygonis2012]. Following image calibration, a region of interest (ROI) was manually defined for each side of every boulder to measure the total surface area (‘*Boulder.area*’) and the exposed area (‘*Expo.area*’), corresponding to regions not covered by the macroalgae canopy. Within the ROI of the exposed area, 70 stratified random points (marker: circle, size: 10, width: 2) were generated to quantify substrate cover. Each point was classified into one of the following substrate categories: "hard" red crust algae (CCA, *Lithothamnium* sp.), “soft” red crust algae (*Peyssonnelia* sp.), dead red crusts (which includes both types of red algae), ascidians, bryozoans, cnidarians, polychaets, mollusks, sponges, bare rock, holes, microbial mats, and unidentifiable substrates. While some *Peyssonnelia* species possess partially calcified cell walls, they lack the substantial calcium carbonate deposits characteristic of true crustose coralline algae. This gives them a softer and more flexible texture compared to the rigid structure of heavily calcified red algae [@guimaraes1999].

## Statistical Analysis

We organized our dataset into ten explanatory variables. Fluorescent substrates (‘*Flu.cover*’) included living cover of "hard" red crust algae (‘*Live.cca*’) and "soft" red crust algae (‘*Live.pey*’). Non-fluorescent substrates (‘*Unflu.cover*’) comprised the cover of dead red crusts (‘*Dead.red.crust*’) and other non-fluorescent components (‘*Unflu.others*’), such as bare rock and microbial mats. Additional substrate categories included ascidian cover (‘*Asc.cover*’), bryozoan cover (‘*Bryo.cover*’), sponge cover (‘*Spong.cover*’), and a grouped category (‘*Others*’) including holes and unidentifiable substrates.


A data exploration analysis was conducted following the protocol of @zuur2010 (see Supplementary Material A). To assess differences among reefs, we used the Kruskal-Wallis test (hereafter as KW test), followed by Dunn’s post-hoc test with Bonferroni correction. Correlations among variables were evaluated using Kendall’s tau coefficient. To minimize multicollinearity, Variance Inflation Factor (VIFs) were calculated, and the variable ‘*Unflu.cover*’ was excluded to ensure all VIF values remained below 2 [@zuur2010].


For model building, we opted for a top-down selection strategy [@west2022]. An initial full model was fitted, excluding cnidarian, polychaete, and mollusk variables due to their low cumulative cover (<1%). Given that site-level effect were not the objective of our study, we considered including '*Site*' as a random factor. The model was then simplified by  sequentially removing non-significant fixed effects (p ≥ 0.05), retaining only those variables essential for maintaining the model’s optimal fit (@zuur2009; see Supplementary Material B). 


Model selection was based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), with a decrease in ΔBIC ≥1 interpreted as a substantial improvement in model performance [@burnham2002]. Bayesian model weights (ranging from 0 to 1) were calculated to evaluate the relative plausibility of each candidate model. Nested models were compared using likelihood ratio test via ANOVA, incorporating corrections for testing on the boundary as recommended by @zuur2009. 


Following model selection, scaled residuals were computed and assessed for deviations from uniformity through visual inspection and formal goodness-of-fit test using simulated residuals in the ‘DHARMa’ package [hartig2022]. To evaluate whether the abundance of chitons ('*Chitons*') was associated with fluorescent substrate coverage ('*Flu.cover*') on boulder sides, we fitted a zero-inflated Poisson generalized linear mixed model (ziGLMM Poisson), including ‘*Sites*’ as a random effect. A square root transformation was applied to the predictor to improve the model fit


To futher explore whether the observed effect reflected a species-specific relationship with distinct types of red crust algae ("hard" or "soft"), we constructed an alternative model using ‘*Live.cca*’ and ‘*Live.pey*’ as separate predictors. The final selected model was a zero-inflated Negative Binomial GLMM (ziGLMM Negative Binomial), which best accommodated overdispersion in the data. All statistical analyses were conducted in R (R Development Core Team, 2024), with GLMM models fitted using the glmmTMB package [@brooks2017].


# Results

## General characterization and comparison among reefs

A total of 137 chitons were recorded, with adults comprising 95.6% of the regional population. Juvenile chitons, 1°-5° developmental stage (Jardim, 2015), accounted for 4.4%, resulting in a ratio of one juvenile every 20 adults. Chitons occupied 36.6% of the boulders sampled, with an encounter rate of approximately nine chitons per hour. During sampling, only eight individuals were observed active on the side of the boulders. At the reef scale, Búzios showed a significantly higher chiton abundance compared to other locations (p<0.01, KW test), with an average density of 3.60 chitons per boulder (Table 1). Significant variation was observed in water levels (mean $\pm$ SD: 37.9 $\pm$ 31.8 cm, p<0.01, KW test) and water temperature (30.7 $\pm$ 1.5 °C, p<0.01, KW test). The boulders had an average weight of 7.0 $\pm$ 6.3 kg, ranging from 1.5 to 25 kg, with no significant weight differences across reefs (p=0.53, KW test). Similarly, estimated surfaces areas showed consistent values across reefs (267 $\pm$ 144 cm^2^, p=0.70, KW test).


The exposed surface area of the boulder sides averaged 222 $\pm$ 121 cm^2^, with a range of 60.78 to 698.36 cm^2^. No significant differences were observed among reefs (p=0.44, KW test). On average, the exposed side surfaces consisted of 54.11 $\pm$ 20.19% fluorescent substrates, 31.83 $\pm$ 18.29% non-fluorescent substrates, 12.10 $\pm$ 12.07% animal coverage, and 1.96 $\pm$ 2.45% other components. Red-crusted algae were consistently present on the side faces of all sampled boulders, accounting 47.52 $\pm$ 21.39% crustose coralline algae (*Lithothamnium* sp.) and 6.59 $\pm$ 12.50% soft red-crusted algae (*Peyssonnelia* sp.). Despite their lower coverage, soft red crusts were found on 66% of the boulder’s side faces (Supplementary Material A). Animal coverage was primarily composed of ascidians (5.79 $\pm$ 7.78%), sponges (2.83 $\pm$ 4.85%), and bryozoans (1.54 $\pm$ 4.14%). Among these, only bryozoans showed no significant differences among reefs (Table 2).


## Chitons abundance increases with fluorescent and bryozoans covers

Our best model reveals that chiton abundance significantly increases with higher percentages of fluorescent substrate on the sides of the boulders, regardless of reefs characteristics (Table 3). Specifically, chiton’s abundance increases at a rate of 0.02 chitons per percentage of fluorescent substrates (ziGLMM Poisson, z=3.11, SE=0.01, p=0.002, Figure 2). The square root of bryozoan cover was essential for maintaining the structure of the best-fitted model. However, its influence on chitons was interpreted with parsimony, as it was close to the significance threshold (ziGLMM Poisson, z=1.96, SE=0.11, p=0.049).


When assessing the species-specific relationship between chitons and red crust algae, algal cover did not predict a higher likelihood of chiton abundance on boulders. Instead, bryozoan cover emerged as the key predictor, showing a proportional linear increase in chiton abundance as bryozoan cover expanded on the boulder sides (Tabela 3). This relationship corresponds to a growth rate of 0.06 chitons per percentage increase of bryozoan cover (GLMM Negative Binomial, z=2.28, SE=0.03, p=0.022).


# Discussion

The Western Atlantic chiton, Ischnoplax pectinata, is a mollusk species with limited biological knowledge, typically found beneath boulders in the intertidal reefs of northeastern Brazil. Like other intertidal organisms, its activity seems to be influenced by tidal and non-tidal rhythms. Boulder chiton species are often observed crawling and feeding on the side surfaces of boulders during twilight (Glynn, 1970; Yoshioka and Fujitani, 2006; Aguilera and Navarete, 2012). However, I. pectinata stands apart, as its shells exhibit fluorescence when exposed to short-wavelength light, such as blue and UV light (Grimaldi et al., 2023). This phenomenon suggests that light interacts with their shell surfaces in ways that differ from typical reflection (Johnsen, 2011). Red crust algae are abundant along the edges of intertidal boulders (Liversage, 2016) and contain high concentrations of fluorescent pigments in their composition (Glazer, 1994). Although the chiton-red algae association is well-documented, most studies have primarily focused on their trophic relationships, leaving other aspects largely unexplored (Sigwart, 2018). Here, we propose that the relationship between I. pectinata and red crust algae may involve a visual component, potentially serving as camouflage against visually guided predators. Specifically, we hypothesize that I. pectinata is more abundant on boulders with greater coverage of fluorescent substrates on their sides. To test this, we constructed statistical models to analyze field ecological data, investigating whether chitons abundance correlates with the percentage of fluorescent substrate coverage on boulder sides and whether this relation is influenced by a species-specific effect of red crust algae. Our best-fitting model showed a clear positive association between chiton abundance and the level of fluorescent substrate coverage on boulder sides. Notably, bryozoan cover was a significant stabilizing predictor in the model that included fluorescent substrate coverage. It also emerged as the main predictor of chiton abundance in models evaluating the specific role of red crust algae, suggesting it may have a critical or complementary role.

Chitons species exhibit a wide range of feeding habits, including specialized strategies such as carnivory (McLean, 1962; Saito and Okutani, 1992), spongivory (Warrén2 and Klitgarrd, 1991), and xylophagy (Sirenko, 2004; Duperron et al., 2013). Despite this diversity, intertidal chitons are generally regarded as omnivorous browsers. Their gut contents often contain a diverse array of materials, including animals, plants, rock fragments, sand, and inorganic detritus (Demopulos, 1975; Fulton, 1975; Langer, 1978, 1983; Piercy, 1987; Camus, 2012). This broad range of ingested items is largely attributed to their feeding mechanism, which relies on a radula - a belt-like, muscular strap equipped with rows of iron oxide-mineralized teeth (Joester and Brooker 2016). This structure enables chitons to scrape and ingest materials indiscriminately, a process commonly referred to as ‘bulldozing’ (Smith and Otway, 1997; Liversage and Kotta, 2019). In the case of I. pectinata, its observed biofluorescence may result from the direct or accidental ingestion of red crustose algae, such as Lithothamnium spp. and Peyssonnelia spp. These algae are rich in phycobiliproteins, highly fluorescent compounds that might undergo biomineralization within the chiton's shell (Peebles et al., 2017). Although crustose coralline algae and bryozoans are frequently found in the diets of many chiton species (Nishi, 1975; Piercy, 1987; Gordon, 1972; Byrnes and Stachowicz, 2009), it is possible that chitons primarily target smaller associated organisms, such as copepods, amphipods, or diatoms, which inhabit these substrates (Osman and Haugsness, 1981; Lidgard, 2008). To better understand the feeding ecology of I. pectinata, examining its intestinal and radula morphology may provide more definitive insights than stomach/ gut content analysis alone (Sigwart and Schwabe, 2017).

Our model achieves the best fit when accounting for the combined role of red crustose algae as fluorescent substrates, rather than considering isolated effects. This highlights the potential importance of visual aspects of the habitat in determining the spatial distribution of chitons, which are highly light-sensitive organisms (Li et al., 2015). Chitons larvae, known as trochophores, develop functional eyes within three day of age (Sirenko, 2018), enabling them to detect and respond to visual cue in their environment. Laboratory experiments have shown that trochophore larvae actively select settlement site on crustose coralline algae (Barnes and Gonor, 1973; Rumrill and Cameron, 1983) or colonies of bryozoans (Creese, 1986). At finer spatial scales, visual cues may play a more significant role than chemical ones in guiding larval settlement (Ambrose, 2021). In particular, fluorescence can amplify the visual intensity of a surface, making more attracting to positive photosensitive larvae (Matsumura and Qian, 2014). Like many animals with planktonic larvae, this light sensitivity response undergoes ontogenetic changes (Marshall et al., 1999). For example, the boulder chiton Ischnochiton magdallensis undergoes a shift in phototropism during its life cycle: larvae are positive phototropic, whereas adults exhibit negative phototropism (Arey and Crozier, 1919). This transition reflects the differing visual requirements between planktonic larvae stage and their adult niche, often demanding substantial optical reorganization (Cronin et al., 2014). Our observations indicate potential differentiation in habitat use between life stages, as juveniles were rarely found sharing boulders with adults. This pattern suggests an ontogenetic niche shift, possibly driven by reproductive needs or predator avoidance (Sánchez-Hernández et al., 2019). A long-term population study could provide valuable insights into the ecological trade-offs associated with these shifts across ontogeny and seasonal cycles.

Boulder reefs are typically characterized by habitat specialist species that are patchily distributed across the reef landscape (Smith and Otway, 1997; Chapman, 2005). These organisms often exhibit aggregated spatial distributions, with large numbers occupying some boulders while others remain unoccupied (Grayson and Chapman, 2004; Palmer, 2012; Chapman, 2002; Smoothey, 2007). Research on boulder reefs has primarily focused on the lower and upper surfaces of individual boulder, while the sides remain understudied (Kangas and Shepherd, 1984; Chapman, 2005; Liversage et al., 2012; Liversage & Kotta, 2015). However, mobile benthic species utilize boulder habitats in a three-dimensional manner, moving across various surfaces (Evans, 1951; Wells, 1980). For instance, boulder chitons emerge at specific times of the day to feed on the sides of boulders (Liversage and Benkendorff, 2017). Our study quantified the environmental and biological factors influencing chiton abundance on the sides of boulders. The observed positive relationship with fluorescent substrates and bryozoan coverage suggests that these factors may act as biological facilitators, enhancing habitat suitability. They likely aid chitons in detecting optimal settlement sites or provide ecological benefits such as camouflage, food resources, or microhabitats that support their survival. These finding highlight the intricate dynamics of boulder reef ecosystems, where ecological interactions among organisms significantly influence community structure. In this context, chitons, as mobile benthic grazers, play a vital role in sustaining ecological balance. Their movement among boulders and daily activity may support the health and resilience of these ecosystems in the face of disturbances. Future research should explore how these patterns affect broader community interactions and contribute to the long-term stability and functionality of reef habitats.

The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report confirms with “high confidence” that seawater pH has decreased globally over the past 40 years, signaling ongoing process of ocean acidification (IPCC, 2023). This phenomzenon is driven by the absorption of atmospheric CO2, which alters seawater chemistry and reduce the saturation state of calcium carbonate – a critical component for the skeletons and shells of many marine organisms (Jones et al., 2017; Osborne et al., 2020). Ocean acidification could affect biomineralizing organisms on boulder reef differently, with some being more vulnerable than others. Crustose coralline algae, for instance, are particularly susceptible to these changes (Kamenos et al., 2016), while other lineages, such as Peyssonelia and bryozoans, have demonstrated adaptative responses (Linares et al., 2015; Swezey et al., 2017). Chitons is a group of mollusks that has persisted through significant environmental changes throughout Earth’s history (Sigwart and Carey, 2014). Experiments reveal that their shell valves are exceptionally resilient to acidification (Sigwart et al., 2015; Peebles and Smith, 2019). However, modern global changes pose challenges that extend beyond ocean acidification and rising temperature. Factors such as hypoxia in coastal habitats (Melzner et al., 2013), declining food availability (Thomsen et al., 2013), and an increase in storm frequency and intensity (IPCC, 2023) threaten to disrupt coastal ecosystems. These disturbances are particularly significant for intertidal zones, where altered hydrodynamics can reshape the disturbance regimes affecting habitat stability. Boulder reefs are particularly to these disturbances due their inherently unstable structure. They are frequently subjected to wave action, sand abrasion, and collision with logs, driftwood, artificial debris or among boulders, resulting in substantial physical damage. These stressors may interact with broader climate-driven changes, creating diverse and unpredictable effects at multiple ecological scales. The resulting pressures can influence not only the survival of individuals organisms but also the balance of ecological interaction within these habitats. 

Boulder reefs are highly complex and dynamic ecosystems, characterized by their inherent instability and intricate ecological interactions. Understanding the relationships that underspin these environments is crucial for predicting how they will respond to future scenarios of global change. In this study, we investigated a biofluorescent chiton species and its association with substrate coverage on the sides of its boulder habitats. Our find reveals a direct correlation between chiton abundance and the coverage of fluorescent substrates and bryozoans. Furthermore, we explore the possibility that the chiton-red crust algae association extends beyond a simple trophic interaction, potentially involving visual aspects enhanced by fluorescence. Fluorescence may play a critical role in communication, habitat selection, and predator-prey dynamics, suggesting it could have significant ecological implications. Investigating how these visual processes are shaped by environmental changes provides valuable insights into the broader ecological consequences of global change. By exploring these connections, researchers can uncover how climate-induced disruptions shape the structure and resilience of boulder reef ecosystems, offering guidance for their conservation in an era of rapid change.
