# Abstract

Boulder reefs are dynamic ecosystems characterized by their structural complexity and diversity communities of specialist species. Boulder dwellers organisms rely on sensory cues to evaluate habitat quality, particularly during critical processes such as larval settlement and adult dispersion. While research on boulder reefs has predominantly focused on the upper and lower surfaces of boulders, the ecological dynamics of the boulder sides remain understudied. The Western Atlantic chiton, *Ischnoplax pectinata*, is a biofluorescent mollusk commonly found beneath intertidal boulders in northeastern Brazil. These chitons exhibit three-dimensional movement on a boulder habitat, emerging at specific times to feed on the boulder sides. Red crust algae, commonly found along the edges of intertidal boulders, are rich in fluorescent pigments, suggesting a potential ecological link to chiton behavior and distribution. This study investigated whether chiton abundance correlates with the percentage of fluorescent substrate coverage on boulder sides and whether this relation is influenced by a species-specific effect of red crust algae, using statistical models to analyze field data. Results showed a positive association between chiton abundance and fluorescent substrate coverage, with bryozoan cover emerging as a critical stabilizing predictor. In models specifically assessing red crust algae, bryozoans were identified as the primary predictor of chiton abundance, suggesting a complementary ecological role. These findings support the hypothesis that the relationship between *I. pectinata* and red crust algae extends beyond a simple trophic interaction, involving visual and behavioral dynamics influenced by fluorescence. Understanding the ecological significance of fluorescence provides valuable insights into how visual environmental cues shape species interactions and ecosystem structure. This research underscores the importance of conserving rocky reef ecosystems to ensure their resilience and functional integrity amid global environmental change. By exploring these connections, researchers can uncover how climate-induced disruptions shape the structure and resilience of coastal reef ecosystems, offering guidance for their conservation in an era of rapid climatic changes.

# Introduction

Coastal reefs are facing unprecedented Anthropogenic driven threats to their continued existence as biodiverse and functional ecosystems upon which hundreds of millions of people rely [@hughes2017]. These include well-known systems like coral reefs, rocky shores, and seagrasses, along with lesser-known habitats such as rhodolith beds, sandstone reef, boulder fields, and others [@soares2017; @tucker2017; @schubert2025]. Boulder fields, also known as boulder reefs, are lesser-known marine ecosystems that harbor biodiverse communities, including rare and habitat-specialist species. These systems are globally distributed across coastal and littoral zones in temperate and tropical regions [@liversage2018a] and have served as foundation ecosystems for the development of our ecological theories, particularly those related to predation, competition and disturbance [@connell1961; @paine1969; @menge1972; @sousa1979a]. A boulder, in geological terms, refers to a detached rock fragment (i.e. piece of stone) larger than 256 mm, regardless of its shape [@wentworth1922]. When submerged in natural aquatic environments, these loose rock fragments often become colonized by sessile benthic organisms [@wilson1987]. This holds ecological significance for two main reasons. First, in aquatic ecosystems, hard substrates are a limited resource for encrusting and boring organisms, leading to space competition [@barnes2003]. Second, individual boulders serve as discrete, measurable unit for study [@sousa1979]. Moreover, their mobility allows them to be overturned by weather events, causing disturbance within their associated communities [@sousa1979a; @mcguinness1987a; @li2023]. Evidence of this disturbance process can even be detectable in the fossil record [@surlyk1974; @wilson1985]. In intertidal zones, disturbances may arise from wave action [@sousa1979a], currents and storms [@li2023], and human activities [@stagnol2013]. Additionally, microscale disturbance can result from wave-borne projectiles (e.g. logs, driftwood, pebbles, cobbles and even other boulders), as well as sand abrasion or ice scour [@daly1977; @shanks1986; @barnes2001]. The rate of boulder overturning depends on factors such as size, mass, shape, burial, orientation, and location [@mcguinness1987a; @lorang2000; @goto2010; @gomez-pazo2021]. Consequently, the disturbance frequency, combined with the intrinsic characteristics of boulders, leads to boulder reefs being spatially arranged as a mosaic of patches at different stages of community development over [@osman1977; @sousa1984; @mcguinness1986]. This creates a highly dynamic, patchy, and unstable marine ecosystem.


An organism is intrinsically integrated to its environment, continuously interacting with its physical and chemical properties (Maturana and Varela, 1987). These properties can be observed as cues and signals, which organisms use as sources of information to establish ecological relationships and adapt to a changing world (Stevens, 2013; Delhey and Peters, 2017). These interactions are primarily mediated by the sensory system, which delineates the organism's sensory environments (Krapp and Wicklein, 2008) and, ultimately, its ecological niche (Jaeger, 1978). At a finer scale, factors such as resource availability, reproductive needs, competition, predation risk, and disturbance regime act as filters, shaping behaviors that enable individuals to select high-quality habitats for survival and reproduction (Kimirei et al., 2013; Majoris et al, 2018; Hyman et al, 2024). These patterns of habitat use define, at broader scales, the critical areas necessary for the population's long-term survival and reproduction, leading to spatial-temporal heterogeneity observed at the community level (Rosenzweig1987; DeAngelis and Grimm, 2014; Leibold and Chase 2018). In patchy landscapes such as boulder reefs, habitat specialist organisms often select environments that maximize their fitness (Price, 2010; Rimmer et al., 2021). Boulder dwellers species are particularly influenced by their ability to use sensory cues to evaluate habitat quality, especially during processes like larval settlement or spatial distribution (Silén and Jansson, 1972; Svane and Dolmer, 1995; Sumner-Rooney et al., 2020). Studies on larval settlement have shown that the spectral characteristics and brightness of substrates positively influence habitat selection in photosensitive planktonic larvae of various benthic invertebrate species (Satheesh and Wesley 2010; Mason et al., 2011; Ells et al., 2016). As many shallow-water marine organisms are light-sensitive during at least one phase of their life cycle (Cronin et al., 2017), light plays a pivotal role in the bioecology of these species (Marshall, 2017).


Light is the driving force behind most ecosystems, playing a fundamental role in essential biological processes such as photosynthesis, photoperiodism, biological rhythms, phototaxis, and vision [@bjorn2015; @bhadra2017; @brelsford2019]. It influences specie distribution, productivity, and ecological interactions [@floder2002; @cohen2002; @thrane2014], while acting as a selective pressure that drives evolutionary changes in behaviors, physiology, and morphology [@lahti2016; @rapf2016; @beckstead2016]. Its availability and effective utilization by living organisms depend on how it interacts with matter [@brandbury2011]. For instance, the amount (i.e. photons number) and quality (i.e. wavelength or frequency) of sunlight reaching the seafloor are influenced by factors such as depth, sun position, phytoplankton concentration, suspended sediment, and dissolved organic matter (Nilsson et al., 2022). Similarly, the quality of light reaching visual pigments is shaped by the optical properties of pre-retinal media (e.g. cornea, lens, and humors) and specialized structures like oil droplets and tapeta [@cronin2014]. This interaction gives rise to an extraordinary diversity of color patterns in nature, functioning as visual signals for sociosexual communication [@kato2024], camouflage [@cuthill2019a], and aposematism [@caro2019a], as well as visual cues for shelter-seeking [@costa2023], foraging [@spaethe2001], and conspecific recognition [@silva2024]. These color patterns emerge from contrasts between color patches, primarily generated by three mechanisms: 1) selective absorption by pigments, 2) light reflection from structural mechanisms in the integument (i.e., structural colors), and 3) self-generated light through biochemical processes, known as bioluminescence [@cuthill2017; @schramm2024]. Within the first mechanism, fluorescent pigments (i.e., fluorophores) have attracted particular attention due to the growing number of documented biofluorescent animals, including sponges [@read1968; @mazel2003b], corals [@eyal2015], hydrozoans [@maggioni2020], siphonophores [@haddock2015], planarians [@stubenhaus2016], worms [@mazel2003b], chitons [@ramesh2021; @grimaldi2023], bivalves [@miyoshi1987; @wanamaker2009], seasnails [@williams2016], nudibranchs [@betti2021a], barnacles [@matsumura2014], crabs [@juhasz-dora2024], stomatopds [@mazel2004], tardigrades [@suma2020], insects [@welch2012; @messenger2019], spiders [@lim2007; @brandt2017], fish [@anthes2016; @sparks2014a], frogs [@taboada2017a], salamanders [@lamb2020a], turtles [@gruber2015a], geckos [@protzel2021], birds [@arnold2002; @wilkinson2019], and mammals [@olson2021a; @anich2021]. Fluorescent pigments can transfer energy across the optical spectrum, altering their spectral characteristics (i.e. color). As a result, light emitted by a fluorescent surface or pigment typically has lower energy (i.e., longer wavelength) than absorbed light [@johnsen2011]. While this does not introduce additional energy into the systems, fluorophores can increase photon output, potentially enhancing the brightness of an organism's surface [@mazel2004; @montgomerie2006]. However, the ecological and evolutionary role of biofluorescence remains debated [@iriel2010; @marshall2017; @mazel2017], with some studies suggesting that fluorescence may amplify visual signals [@whitcher2024], potentially influencing mate choice [@arnold2002; @mazel2004; @lim2007] and settlement of planktonic larvae of marine benthic organisms [@matsumura2014]. 


Chitons are multi-shelled mollusks that are strongly associated with hard marine substrates [@eernisse2007]. Their most remarkable feature is their eight-plate shell, equipped with various sensory receptors that are highly sensitive to light [@liu2022]. Some species even possess specialized 'shell eyes' capable of image formation and polarization vision [@speiser2011; @li2015; @chappell2023]. This sensory-integrated armor, shared by all modern chitons (dating back to the early Carboniferous ca. 340 Mya), closely resembles that of plate-bearing ancestral species from the early Cambrian ca. 540 Mya [@sigwart2009; @parkhaev2017]. This adaptation likely enabled chitons to survive major climate changes and Earth’s surface transformation throughout history [@wanninger2019], allowing them to inhabit a diverse range of environments today, from coastal areas to deep seas [@kangas1984; @schwabe2004; Konar et al., 2006; Saito et al., 2008; Barros et al., 2013; Reyes-Gómez et al., 2017; Sigwart, 2017; Barboza, 2019). Chitons also possess an iron-mineralized radula, which is use to scrape food from the substrates, ingesting various organisms and sediment particles [@fulton1975; @joester2016]. Consequently, many intertidal species can digest both plant and animal material, making them browsing omnivorous [@latyshev2004; @sigwart2017]. Ecologically, chitons play a role in regulating algal growth through grazing, while also unintentionally impact community diversity by creating a “bulldozing-effect” on larvae and post-metamorphic invertebrate stages, influencing community structure and composition [@aguilera2007; @aguilera2012; @aguilera2015; @liversage2019]. Boulder chitons are habitat specialist species that fully utilize the three-dimensional structure of their habitat [@liversage2017a]. Their behavior is influenced by both tidal and non-tidal rhythms, including the light-dark cycle, tidal regime, seasonal changes, climate and temperature variations, habitat features, food availability, and interactions with other species [@glynn1970; @kangas1984; @yoshioka2006; @ng2006]. These factors contribute to behavioral diversity across habitats and species [@cretchley1997].


Chitons are closely associated with red crust algae [@steneck1982a], relying on coralline crustose as a primary food source [@piercy1987; @littler1995; @camus2012] and larval settling surface [@barnes1973; @rumrill1983; @figueiredo1997;@roberts2010; @ritson-williams2014]. Red algae are easily recognized by their reddish hue, which primarily results from accessory pigments known as phycobilins [@lee2018]. These phycobiliproteins are highly fluorescent components of light-harvesting photosynthetic antenna complexes [@glazer1994]. In oceanic habitats, wavelength-dependent absorption by water causes the broad-spectrum sunlight at the surface to narrow with increasing depth, shifting the ambient light spectrum toward blue [@cronin2014]. This environment condition favors fluorescence by providing suitable light to induce it while also enhancing potential visual functions [@anthes2016; @meadows2014]. Similarly, intertidal habitats may also experience a narrow "blue" light spectrum during twilight [@cronin2014]. A recent study has shown that the twilight spectrum plays an important role in anurans communication through biofluorescent signals in anurans [@whitcher2024a]. Many intertidal boulder chitons species are active during twilight, emerging at dawn or dusk to forage along the vertical surfaces [@langer1978]. The chiton *Ischnoplax pectinata* (G. B. Sowerby II, 1840) has an exclusive distribution in the Western Atlantic, ranging in depth from 0 to 55 meters [@gomes2015]. Limited knowledge exists regarding its ecology and behavior, but the specie is commonly found in intertidal rocky reefs, specifically underneath loose boulders during low tide. Apparently, the species exhibits fluorescence in its shell plates when artificially exposed to narrow light spectra [@grimaldi2023]. 


Most studies on the spatial distribution of boulder chitons have focused on the upper and lower surfaces of boulders [@evans1951; @kangas1984; @smith1997; @grayson2004; @mcclintock2007; @chapman2012; @liversage2017a]. In boulder habitats, red crust algae typically grow around boulders edge [@liversage2016]. This has led to the hypothesis that the chiton species I. pectinata may be more abundant on boulders with higher fluorescent coverage along the sides, which could provide both a food source and a visual background for camouflage against visually guided predators [@sigwart2018]. In this study, we investigate whether the coverage of fluorescent substrates, specifically red crust algae, on the sides of boulders influences the spatial distribution of the biofluorescent chiton *I. pectinata*. Our hypotheses are: 1) boulders with a higher percentage of fluorescent substrate coverage on their side surfaces will have a greater abundance of chitons, and 2) this relationship is not influenced by a species-specific effect of the red crust algae.


# Material and Methods

## Study site

Our research was conducted in four intertidal reefs, arranged from north to south: Pitangui (05°37’S 35°13’W), Santa Rita (05°41’S 35°11’W), Búzios (06°00’S 35°06’W), and Baía Formosa (06°22’S 34°59’W). These reefs are situated along approximately 90 km of the eastern coast of Rio Grande do Norte, on the northeast coast of Brazil (Figure 1). The region experienced a tropical humid climate, with annual precipitation reaching up to 1500mm, mainly occurring during the austral spring (Vital et al., 2016). The dry season runs from October to December, while the rainy season lasts from February to September (Diniz and Pereira, 2015). During the dry season, sea temperature averages 28 ± 0.01°C (mean±SD), with salinity of 35 ± 0.02. In the rainy season, these values drop to 27 ± 0.03°C and 34 ± 0.06 respectively (Hazin et al., 2008). Winds come predominantly from the southeast (Silva et al., 2002) with a mean speed ranging between 3.7 m/s (April) and 5.1 m/s (October) (Barros 2013). Tides follow a semi-diurnal pattern with a meso-tidal regime (Vital et al., 2016). The beaches are primarily composed of siliciclastic sands, consisting mainly of moderately sorted fine to medium-grained quartz, with carbonate sediments observed as biodendritic gravel (Vital, 2009). Small rivers contribute to reduced fluvial discharge and depositing coarse silt sediments (‘muddy’) primarily at their mouths (Vital et al., 2016).

## *Field Methods/ Data Collection*

Our sampling was carried out during low tide between April and May 2021, encompassing a total of 120 boulders (30 boulders per reef). Before sampling, we conducted a preliminary search at each reef to locate the presence of the chiton species I. pectinata in the sampling area. Once identified, we randomly selected a direction using a digital stopwatch (Gotelli and Ellison, 2012) to determine North (odd/odd), East (odd/even), South (even/even), or West (even/odd). We then walked (15 steps) in the chosen direction and selected the nearest accessible boulder that could be overturned without being buried or trapped (Palmer, 2012). Using the stopwatch again, we decided whether to sample the boulder or not. If the decision was negative or if we left the sampling area, we repeated the process. There was no restriction on the weight of the boulders, as long as they could be overturned and moved (Palmer, 2012). At each boulder, we recorded the abundance of attached chitons of I. pectinata (‘Chitons’), water temperature (‘Temp’), tide level relative to the boulder’s base (‘Wt.level’), and weight (‘Weight’). Photographs of the underside and all sides of each boulder, with a scale included, were taken for subsequent analysis. Each boulder was weighed using a handheld scale and a cloth bag. To minimize any potential impact on chiton abundance, these measurements were performed as the final step. All boulders were georeferenced and treated as independent habitat unit (Palmer, 2012). After sampling, each boulder was carefully returned to its original position and orientation.

Images were analyzed using PhotoQuad software (Trygonis and Sini, 2012). After calibrating the images, a region of interest (ROI) was manually defined for each boulder and side to measure the total boulder surface area (‘Boulder.area’) and the exposed side area (‘Expo.area’), representing areas not covered by the macroalgae canopy. Within the ROI of the exposed side area, 70 stratified random points (marker: circle, size: 10, width: 2) were generated to determine substrate coverage percentages. These points were categorized into the following coverage types: living crustose coralline algae (CCA, Lithothamnium sp.), “soft” red crust algae (Peyssonnelia sp.), dead red crusts (which includes both red algae types), ascidians, bryozoans, cnidarians, polychaets, mollusks, sponges, bare rock, holes, microbial mats, and unidentifiable substrates. Although some Peyssonnelia species have heavily calcified cell walls, they lack the substantial calcium carbonate deposits characteristic of many crustose coralline algae. This distinction gives Peyssonnelia a softer and more flexible texture, contrasting with the rigid structure typical of calcified red algae (Guimarães and Fujii, 1999).

## *Statistical Analysis*

We organized our data into ten explanatory variables. Fluorescent substrates (‘Flu.cover’), which include living coverage of "hard" red crust algae (‘Live.cca’) and "soft" red crust algae (‘Live.pey’). Non-fluorescent substrates (‘Unflu.cover’), comprised coverage of dead red crusts (‘Dead.red.crust’) and other non-fluorescent substrates (‘Unflu.others’), such as bare rock and microbial mats. Additional variables included ascidian coverage (‘Asc.cover’), bryozoan coverage (‘Bryo.cover’), sponge coverages (‘Spong.cover’), and ‘Others’ (holes and unidentifiable substrates). Subsequently, we conducted a data exploration analysis (Supplementary Material A) following the protocol described by Zuur et al. (2010). To one-way comparisons across reefs, we used the Kruskal-Wallis test (hereafter as KW test) and Dunn’s multiple comparison post-hoc test with Bonferroni correction. Variable correlations were assessed using Kendall’s tau coefficient. To avoid collinearity, we calculated the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), excluding the variable ‘Unflu.cover’ to ensure VIF values below 2 (Zuur et al., 2010). For model building, we opted for a top-down strategy (West et al., 2022). A loaded mean structure model was fitted, excluding cnidarian, polychaete, and mollusk variables due to their low combined coverage (<1%). Since our focus was not on assessing the effect of different reefs on chiton abundance, we considered incorporating a random effect structure for ‘Sites’. The model was simplified by removing non-significant fixed effects (p-values below or near 0.05, Zuur et al., 2009), retaining only those essential for preserving the model’s optimal fit (Supplementary Material B). 


Bayesian information criterion (BIC) was used to rank alternative (nested) models, with a decrease in ΔBIC of ≥1 considered a substantial improvement (Burnham and Anderson, 2002). Bayesian weights, ranging from 0 to 1, were computed for each model, with higher values indicating more plausible models. To compare these nested models, we applied the likelihood ratio test via ANOVA, incorporating corrections for testing on the boundary (Zuur et al., 2009). Following model selection, scaled residuals were computed, visually inspected for deviations from uniformity, and evaluated using fit tests on the simulated residuals with the ‘DHARMa’ package (Hartig and Lohse, 2022). To investigate whether the abundance of fluorescent chitons is influenced by the fluorescent substrate coverage (“Flu.cover”) on the sides of the boulders, we performed a Poisson generalized linear mixed model with zero inflation (ziGLMM Poisson), incorporating ‘Sites’ as a random effect and applying a square root transformation to the predictor for a better fit. To assess whether the effect of fluorescent substrate coverage reflects a species-specific association with the red crust type on boulders, we developed a new model using the predictors ‘Live.cca’ and ‘Live.pey’ as predictors. The final best-fit model was a Negative Binomial generalized linear mixed model with zero inflation (ziGLMM Negative Binomial). All statistical analyses were conducted in R (R Development Core Team, 2024), with GLMM models fitted using the glmmTMB package (Brooks et al., 2017).

## *General characterization and comparison among reefs*

A total of 137 chitons were recorded, with adults comprising 95.6% of the regional population, while juvenile chitons accounted for 4.4%. This gives a ratio of one juvenile chiton for every 20 adults. At the time of sampling, only eight individuals were found in activity on the side of the boulders. Overall, 36.6% of the boulders were occupied by chitons, with an encounter rate of approximately nine chitons per hour. At the reef scale, Búzios exhibited a significantly higher abundance compared to other locations (p<0.01, KW test), with an average density of 3.60 chitons per boulder (Table 1). At the habitat scale, the boulder exhibited consistent weights (p=0.53, KW test) and estimated areas (p=0.70, KW test) across the different reefs. They had an average weight of 7.0 $\pm$ 6.3 kg ($\overline{x}\pm SD$), with a minimum of 1.5 kg and a maximum of 25 kg, and an estimated surface area was 267 $\pm$ 144 cm^2^, ranging from 75 cm^2^ to 830 cm^2^. On the other hand, water levels showed significant variations (p<0.01, KW test), ranging from a minimum of 11.2 $\pm$ 6.3 cm in Santa Rita to a maximum of 76.8 $\pm$ 28.7 cm in Búzios. Consequently, differences in water temperature (30.7 $\pm$ 1.5 °C) were also observed across reefs (p<0.01, KW test), with Pitangui showing the lowest average values (28.9 $\pm$ 0.9 °C) and Santa Rita the highest (32.3 $\pm$ 0.8 °C). 
 
On the boulder's side, the global averaged exposed side surface area was 222 $\pm$ 121 cm^2^, ranging from 60.78 cm^2^ to 698.36 cm^2^. There were no significant variations between reefs (p=0.44, Kruskal-Wallis test). Globally, the exposed side was composed of 54.11 $\pm$ 20.19% fluorescent substrates, 31.83 $\pm$ 18.29% unfluorescent substrates, 12.10 $\pm$ 12.07% animals, and 1.96 $\pm$ 2.45% other components. Fluorescent substrates were present on the side faces of all boulders, including both red crust species, with the  crustose coralline algae (*Lithothamnium* sp.) being the most prominent in all reefs (Table 1). In short, we found variations in the coverage of fluorescent substrates (p<0.01, KW test), crustose coralline algae (p<0.01, KW test), and red soft crust algae (p<0.01, KW test) among reefs (Table 1). Unfluorescent substrates, which included dead red crust (13.63 $\pm$ 10.11%), "bare rock" surfaces and microbial mets (**falta calcular e inserir no Supp A**), also varied among reefs (p<0.01, KW test). Animal coverage primarily consisted of ascidians (5.79 $\pm$ 7.78%), sponges (2.83 $\pm$ 4.85%), and bryozoans (1.54 $\pm$ 4.14%). Among these, only bryozoans showed consistent coverage across different reefs (p=0.27, KW test).

## *Chitons abundance increases with fluorescent and bryozoans covers*

Our analysis shows that the abundance of chitons increases with the rise in fluorescent substrates and bryozoan coverage on the sides of boulders (FIGURE 2). Specifically, chiton's abundance increases at a rate of 0.02 chitons per percentage of fluorescent substrates (ziGLMM Poisson, z=3.11, SE=0.01, p<0.01) and approximately 0.20 chitons per square root of bryozoan coverage (ziGLMM Poisson, z=1.96, SE=0.11, p<0.05). When examined through a species-specific relationship between chitons and red crusts, chiton abundance becomes proportionally linear to the increase of bryozoans, at a rate of 0.05 chitons/bryozoan cover (GLMM Negative Binomial, z=2.28, SE=0.02, p=0.02). In this context, the live cover of neither CCA nor soft red crusts significantly predicted an increased likelihood of the data's occurrence in our model (Table 2).

# **4. Discussion**

The Western Atlantic chiton, Ischnoplax pectinata, is a mollusk species with limited biological knowledge, typically found beneath boulders in the intertidal reefs of northeastern Brazil. Like other intertidal organisms, its activity seems to be influenced by tidal and non-tidal rhythms. Boulder chiton species are often observed crawling and feeding on the side surfaces of boulders during twilight (Glynn, 1970; Yoshioka and Fujitani, 2006; Aguilera and Navarete, 2012). However, I. pectinata stands apart, as its shells exhibit fluorescence when exposed to short-wavelength light, such as blue and UV light (Grimaldi et al., 2023). This phenomenon suggests that light interacts with their shell surfaces in ways that differ from typical reflection (Johnsen, 2011). Red crust algae are abundant along the edges of intertidal boulders (Liversage, 2016) and contain high concentrations of fluorescent pigments in their composition (Glazer, 1994). Although the chiton-red algae association is well-documented, most studies have primarily focused on their trophic relationships, leaving other aspects largely unexplored (Sigwart, 2018). Here, we propose that the relationship between I. pectinata and red crust algae may involve a visual component, potentially serving as camouflage against visually guided predators. Specifically, we hypothesize that I. pectinata is more abundant on boulders with greater coverage of fluorescent substrates on their sides. To test this, we constructed statistical models to analyze field ecological data, investigating whether chitons abundance correlates with the percentage of fluorescent substrate coverage on boulder sides and whether this relation is influenced by a species-specific effect of red crust algae. Our best-fitting model showed a clear positive association between chiton abundance and the level of fluorescent substrate coverage on boulder sides. Notably, bryozoan cover was a significant stabilizing predictor in the model that included fluorescent substrate coverage. It also emerged as the main predictor of chiton abundance in models evaluating the specific role of red crust algae, suggesting it may have a critical or complementary role.

Chitons species exhibit a wide range of feeding habits, including specialized strategies such as carnivory (McLean, 1962; Saito and Okutani, 1992), spongivory (Warrén2 and Klitgarrd, 1991), and xylophagy (Sirenko, 2004; Duperron et al., 2013). Despite this diversity, intertidal chitons are generally regarded as omnivorous browsers. Their gut contents often contain a diverse array of materials, including animals, plants, rock fragments, sand, and inorganic detritus (Demopulos, 1975; Fulton, 1975; Langer, 1978, 1983; Piercy, 1987; Camus, 2012). This broad range of ingested items is largely attributed to their feeding mechanism, which relies on a radula - a belt-like, muscular strap equipped with rows of iron oxide-mineralized teeth (Joester and Brooker 2016). This structure enables chitons to scrape and ingest materials indiscriminately, a process commonly referred to as ‘bulldozing’ (Smith and Otway, 1997; Liversage and Kotta, 2019). In the case of I. pectinata, its observed biofluorescence may result from the direct or accidental ingestion of red crustose algae, such as Lithothamnium spp. and Peyssonnelia spp. These algae are rich in phycobiliproteins, highly fluorescent compounds that might undergo biomineralization within the chiton's shell (Peebles et al., 2017). Although crustose coralline algae and bryozoans are frequently found in the diets of many chiton species (Nishi, 1975; Piercy, 1987; Gordon, 1972; Byrnes and Stachowicz, 2009), it is possible that chitons primarily target smaller associated organisms, such as copepods, amphipods, or diatoms, which inhabit these substrates (Osman and Haugsness, 1981; Lidgard, 2008). To better understand the feeding ecology of I. pectinata, examining its intestinal and radula morphology may provide more definitive insights than stomach/ gut content analysis alone (Sigwart and Schwabe, 2017).

Our model achieves the best fit when accounting for the combined role of red crustose algae as fluorescent substrates, rather than considering isolated effects. This highlights the potential importance of visual aspects of the habitat in determining the spatial distribution of chitons, which are highly light-sensitive organisms (Li et al., 2015). Chitons larvae, known as trochophores, develop functional eyes within three day of age (Sirenko, 2018), enabling them to detect and respond to visual cue in their environment. Laboratory experiments have shown that trochophore larvae actively select settlement site on crustose coralline algae (Barnes and Gonor, 1973; Rumrill and Cameron, 1983) or colonies of bryozoans (Creese, 1986). At finer spatial scales, visual cues may play a more significant role than chemical ones in guiding larval settlement (Ambrose, 2021). In particular, fluorescence can amplify the visual intensity of a surface, making more attracting to positive photosensitive larvae (Matsumura and Qian, 2014). Like many animals with planktonic larvae, this light sensitivity response undergoes ontogenetic changes (Marshall et al., 1999). For example, the boulder chiton Ischnochiton magdallensis undergoes a shift in phototropism during its life cycle: larvae are positive phototropic, whereas adults exhibit negative phototropism (Arey and Crozier, 1919). This transition reflects the differing visual requirements between planktonic larvae stage and their adult niche, often demanding substantial optical reorganization (Cronin et al., 2014). Our observations indicate potential differentiation in habitat use between life stages, as juveniles were rarely found sharing boulders with adults. This pattern suggests an ontogenetic niche shift, possibly driven by reproductive needs or predator avoidance (Sánchez-Hernández et al., 2019). A long-term population study could provide valuable insights into the ecological trade-offs associated with these shifts across ontogeny and seasonal cycles.

Boulder reefs are typically characterized by habitat specialist species that are patchily distributed across the reef landscape (Smith and Otway, 1997; Chapman, 2005). These organisms often exhibit aggregated spatial distributions, with large numbers occupying some boulders while others remain unoccupied (Grayson and Chapman, 2004; Palmer, 2012; Chapman, 2002; Smoothey, 2007). Research on boulder reefs has primarily focused on the lower and upper surfaces of individual boulder, while the sides remain understudied (Kangas and Shepherd, 1984; Chapman, 2005; Liversage et al., 2012; Liversage & Kotta, 2015). However, mobile benthic species utilize boulder habitats in a three-dimensional manner, moving across various surfaces (Evans, 1951; Wells, 1980). For instance, boulder chitons emerge at specific times of the day to feed on the sides of boulders (Liversage and Benkendorff, 2017). Our study quantified the environmental and biological factors influencing chiton abundance on the sides of boulders. The observed positive relationship with fluorescent substrates and bryozoan coverage suggests that these factors may act as biological facilitators, enhancing habitat suitability. They likely aid chitons in detecting optimal settlement sites or provide ecological benefits such as camouflage, food resources, or microhabitats that support their survival. These finding highlight the intricate dynamics of boulder reef ecosystems, where ecological interactions among organisms significantly influence community structure. In this context, chitons, as mobile benthic grazers, play a vital role in sustaining ecological balance. Their movement among boulders and daily activity may support the health and resilience of these ecosystems in the face of disturbances. Future research should explore how these patterns affect broader community interactions and contribute to the long-term stability and functionality of reef habitats.

The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report confirms with “high confidence” that seawater pH has decreased globally over the past 40 years, signaling ongoing process of ocean acidification (IPCC, 2023). This phenomzenon is driven by the absorption of atmospheric CO2, which alters seawater chemistry and reduce the saturation state of calcium carbonate – a critical component for the skeletons and shells of many marine organisms (Jones et al., 2017; Osborne et al., 2020). Ocean acidification could affect biomineralizing organisms on boulder reef differently, with some being more vulnerable than others. Crustose coralline algae, for instance, are particularly susceptible to these changes (Kamenos et al., 2016), while other lineages, such as Peyssonelia and bryozoans, have demonstrated adaptative responses (Linares et al., 2015; Swezey et al., 2017). Chitons is a group of mollusks that has persisted through significant environmental changes throughout Earth’s history (Sigwart and Carey, 2014). Experiments reveal that their shell valves are exceptionally resilient to acidification (Sigwart et al., 2015; Peebles and Smith, 2019). However, modern global changes pose challenges that extend beyond ocean acidification and rising temperature. Factors such as hypoxia in coastal habitats (Melzner et al., 2013), declining food availability (Thomsen et al., 2013), and an increase in storm frequency and intensity (IPCC, 2023) threaten to disrupt coastal ecosystems. These disturbances are particularly significant for intertidal zones, where altered hydrodynamics can reshape the disturbance regimes affecting habitat stability. Boulder reefs are particularly to these disturbances due their inherently unstable structure. They are frequently subjected to wave action, sand abrasion, and collision with logs, driftwood, artificial debris or among boulders, resulting in substantial physical damage. These stressors may interact with broader climate-driven changes, creating diverse and unpredictable effects at multiple ecological scales. The resulting pressures can influence not only the survival of individuals organisms but also the balance of ecological interaction within these habitats. 

Boulder reefs are highly complex and dynamic ecosystems, characterized by their inherent instability and intricate ecological interactions. Understanding the relationships that underspin these environments is crucial for predicting how they will respond to future scenarios of global change. In this study, we investigated a biofluorescent chiton species and its association with substrate coverage on the sides of its boulder habitats. Our find reveals a direct correlation between chiton abundance and the coverage of fluorescent substrates and bryozoans. Furthermore, we explore the possibility that the chiton-red crust algae association extends beyond a simple trophic interaction, potentially involving visual aspects enhanced by fluorescence. Fluorescence may play a critical role in communication, habitat selection, and predator-prey dynamics, suggesting it could have significant ecological implications. Investigating how these visual processes are shaped by environmental changes provides valuable insights into the broader ecological consequences of global change. By exploring these connections, researchers can uncover how climate-induced disruptions shape the structure and resilience of boulder reef ecosystems, offering guidance for their conservation in an era of rapid change.
