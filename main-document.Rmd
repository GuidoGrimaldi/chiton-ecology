# Abstract

Boulder reefs are dynamic ecosystems characterized by their structural complexity and diversity communities of specialist species. Boulder dwellers organisms rely on sensory cues to evaluate habitat quality, particularly during critical processes such as larval settlement and adult dispersion. While research on boulder reefs has predominantly focused on the upper and lower surfaces of boulders, the ecological dynamics of the boulder sides remain understudied. The Western Atlantic chiton, *Ischnoplax pectinata*, is a biofluorescent mollusk commonly found beneath intertidal boulders in northeastern Brazil. These chitons exhibit three-dimensional movement on a boulder habitat, emerging at specific times to feed on the boulder sides. Red crust algae, commonly found along the edges of intertidal boulders, are rich in fluorescent pigments, suggesting a potential ecological link to chiton behavior and distribution. This study investigated whether chiton abundance correlates with the percentage of fluorescent substrate coverage on boulder sides and whether this relation is influenced by a species-specific effect of red crust algae, using statistical models to analyze field data. Results showed a positive association between chiton abundance and fluorescent substrate coverage, with bryozoan cover emerging as a critical stabilizing predictor. In models specifically assessing red crust algae, bryozoans were identified as the primary predictor of chiton abundance, suggesting a complementary ecological role. These findings support the hypothesis that the relationship between *I. pectinata* and red crust algae extends beyond a simple trophic interaction, involving visual and behavioral dynamics influenced by fluorescence. Understanding the ecological significance of fluorescence provides valuable insights into how visual environmental cues shape species interactions and ecosystem structure. This research underscores the importance of conserving rocky reef ecosystems to ensure their resilience and functional integrity amid global environmental change. By exploring these connections, researchers can uncover how climate-induced disruptions shape the structure and resilience of coastal reef ecosystems, offering guidance for their conservation in an era of rapid climatic changes.

# Introduction

Fluorescence is a natural physical process in which light absorbed at shorter wavelengths — typically in the ultraviolet or blue region — is re-emitted at longer wavelengths by fluorescent pigments known as fluorophores [@matz2006c; @taboada2017a; @protzel2021]. This process alters the spectral distribution of the emitted light, producing distinct optical signatures (or "colors", to human vision)  that differ fundamentally from those generated by reflection or scattering [@johnsen2011]. Although fluorescence does not add energy to a system, it can enhance surface brightness by increasing photon output [@arnold2002; @mazel2004; @lim2007]. In biological systems, biofluorescence is taxonomically widespread, occurring across a diverse range of organisms from  both terrestrial and marine ecosystems [@sparks2014c; @macel2020; @carr2025]. Its broad distribution across taxa and environments suggests potential significance as a biological, ecological, and evolutionary trait [@whitcher2024a; @martin2025]. 


Despite being a common trait, the ecological and evolutionary functions of fluorescence remain incompletely understood [@iriel2010; @marshall2017; @whitcher2024]. Various hypothesis have been proposed, including communication [@meadows2014; @kalb2015; @whitcher2024a], prey and pollinator attraction [@thorp1975; @gandia-herrero2005; @kurup2013; @haddock2015], symbiont recruitment [@aihara2019], camouflage [@wucherer2014; @gruber2016d; @debrauwer2016c], mate attraction [@pearn2001; @arnold2002], and enhancement of visual contrast in structurally complex or dim light environments [@bitton2017; @protzel2021a]. These functions vary among species and habitat, reflecting the diversity of ecological contexts in which fluorescence occurs. In marine systems fluorescence, especially the red one, appears to be widespread among cryptobenthic animals [@anthes2016; @harant2017; @michiels2018; @park2019].  However, the ecological consequences of fluorescence in benthic organisms, especially those inhabiting heterogeneous substrates, remain largely unexplored.


Intertidal and shallow subtidal reefs are dynamic habitats characterized by rapid changes in light availability and quality due to tidal cycles, water movement, depth, and the structural complexity of the substrate and overlying algal canopy [@cuthill2019; @nilsson2022].This dynamics creates a complex of light conditions that can influence how organisms perceive and interact with their surroundings [@matchette2018; @matchette2020]. In such enviroments, visual cues play a key role in habitat selection, spatial navigation, communication and species interactions [@attwell2021; @drerup2024]. For benthic organisms in particular, which often depend on close contact with the substrate for protection, feeding, and reproduction, the ability to detect and respond to visual cues in their immediate environment can strongly influence patterns of microhabitat use and species distribution [@mason2011; @matsumura2014; @sumner-rooney2021].


Chitons, or polyplacophorans, are a group of marine mollusks known for their slow movement and strong association with hard substrates [@eernisse2007; @parkhaev2017]. They possess an eight-plate shell equipped with various sensory receptors that are highly sensitive to light [@li2015; @liu2022b]. Some species even have specialized '*shell eyes*' capable of image formation and polarization vision [@speiser2011; @speiser2014; @kingston2018; @chappell2023]. This sensory-integrated armor likely contributed to their survival through  major climate changes and transformation of the  Earth’s surface over geological time [@wanninger2019]. Many chiton species are strongly associated with calcareous red algae [@steneck1986; @littler1995], which contain high concentrations of fluorescent pigments in their tissue [@glazer1994]. In boulder reef, red crustose algae are abundant along the edges of intertidal boulders [@liversage2016], where  chiton species are often observed crawling and feeding on the side surfaces [@yoshioka2006; @aguilera2012]. However, the chiton *Ischnoplax pectinata* (G. B. Sowerby II, 1840) stands apart from the most other species, as its shells exhibit fluorescence when exposed to narrow light spectra [@grimaldi2023], suggesting a potential link between organism and habitat fluorescence that warrants investigation.


Despite growing interest in biofluorescence, few studies have addressed how fluorescent substrates influence habitat selection and distribution patterns of benthic invertebrates [@matsumura2014]. In particular, the relationship between fluorescent backgrounds and the distribution of biofluorescent chitons in intertidal reef environments remains poorly understood. This study aims to fill this gap by exploring whether the coverage of fluorescent substrates on the sides of boulders influences the abundance of the fluorescent chiton *I. pectinata* along intertidal boulder reefs. We hypothesize that: (1) boulders with a higher percentage of fluorescent substrate cover on their side surfaces will host a greater abundance of chitons, and (2) this effect it not driven by a specific species of encrusting algae, but consistent across all fluorescent substrates.


# Material and Methods

## Study site

This study was conducted in the boulder regions of four intertidal reefs spanning approximately 90 km along the eastern coast of Rio Grande do Norte, northeastern Brazil: Baía Formosa (06°22’S 34°59’W), Búzios (06°00’S 35°06’W),  Pitangui (05°37’S 35°13’W), and Santa Rita (05°41’S 35°11’W). The region experiences  a tropical humid climate, with a distinct dry season runs from October to December and a rainy season extending from February to September [@diniz2015; @vital2016]. Tidal cycles are semi-diurnal and follow a meso-tidal regime [@vital2016]. 


## Field Methods/ Data Collection

Sampling was conducted during low tide between April and May 2021, encompassing a total of 120 boulders (30 per reef). Prior to sampling, a preliminary nighttime snorkeling survey was conducted to assess the presence of fluorescent substrates on the side  surfaces of boulders. This fluorescence was visually evaluated using a short-wavelength (~450 nm) flashlight equipped with a long-pass filter (BW-1 Dive Light, NIGHTSEA Llc.). Among the substrates observed, only the red crust algae *Lithothamnium* sp. and *Peyssonnelia* sp. exhibited visible fluorescence. Additionally, each site was surveyed to confirm the presence of the chiton *I. pectinata* in the sampling area. This species is readily identifiable among Brazilian chitons by its relatively large size (up to ~45 mm in length) and elongate body shape [@junior1985]. 


Once the species was confirmed, a random sampling direction was determined using a digital stopwatch, following the method of @gotelli2012: North (odd/odd), East (odd/even), South (even/even), or West (even/odd). We then walked 15 steps in the chosen direction and selected the nearest accessible unstable boulder (*i.e.* that could be overturned without being buried or trapped), a key habitat characteristic for boulder-dwelling chitons species [@palmer2012; @lima2019]. A second stopwatch draw determined whether to sample the selected boulder. If the result  was negative or if the site fell outside the sampling boulder region area, the process was repeated. 


Boulders were selected regardless of weight, provided they could be safety overturned [@palmer2012]. At each boulder, we recorded the abundance of attached *I. pectinata*  individuals (count, ‘*Chitons*’), water temperature (°C, ‘*Temp*’), tide level relative to the boulder’s base (cm, ‘*Wt.level*’), and the boulder weight (kg, ‘*Weight*’). Photographs were taken of the underside and all sides of each boulder, with a scale for reference. Boulder weight was measured using a handheld scale and cloth bag, with weighing conducted last to minimize potential disturbance to the chiton counts. All boulders were georeferenced and treated as independent habitat unit [@palmer2012]. After sampling, each boulder was carefully returned to its original position and orientation.


Images were analyzed using PhotoQuad software [@trygonis2012]. Following image calibration, a region of interest (ROI) was manually defined for each side of every boulder to measure the total surface area (‘*Boulder.area*’) and the exposed area (‘*Expo.area*’), corresponding to regions not covered by the macroalgae canopy. Within the ROI of the exposed area, 70 stratified random points (marker: circle, size: 10, width: 2) were generated to quantify substrate cover. Each point was classified into one of the following substrate categories: "hard" red crust algae (CCA, *Lithothamnium* sp.), “soft” red crust algae (*Peyssonnelia* sp.), dead red crusts (which includes both types of red algae), ascidians, bryozoans, cnidarians, polychaets, mollusks, sponges, bare rock, holes, microbial mats, and unidentifiable substrates. While some *Peyssonnelia* species possess partially calcified cell walls, they lack the substantial calcium carbonate deposits characteristic of true crustose coralline algae (CCA). This gives them a softer and more flexible texture compared to the rigid structure of heavily calcified red algae [@guimaraes1999].


## Statistical Analysis

We organized our dataset into ten explanatory variables. Fluorescent substrates (‘*Flu.cover*’) included living cover of "hard" (‘*Live.cca*’) and "soft" (‘*Live.pey*’) red crust algae. Non-fluorescent substrates (‘*Unflu.cover*’) comprised the cover of dead red crusts (‘*Dead.red.crust*’) and other non-fluorescent components (‘*Unflu.others*’), such as bare rock and microbial mats. Additional substrate categories included ascidian cover (‘*Asc.cover*’), bryozoan cover (‘*Bryo.cover*’), sponge cover (‘*Spong.cover*’), and a grouped category (‘*Others*’) including holes and unidentifiable substrates.


A data exploration analysis was conducted following the protocol of @zuur2010 (see Supplementary Material A). To assess differences among reefs, we used the Kruskal-Wallis test (hereafter as KW test), followed by Dunn’s *post-hoc* test with Bonferroni correction. Correlations among variables were evaluated using Kendall’s tau coefficient. To minimize multicollinearity, Variance Inflation Factor (VIFs) were calculated, and the variable ‘*Unflu.cover*’ was excluded to ensure all VIF values remained below 2 [@zuur2010].


For model building, we opted for a top-down selection strategy [@west2022]. An initial full model was fitted, excluding cnidarian, polychaete, and mollusk variables due to their low cumulative cover (<1%). Given that site-level effect were not the objective of our study, we considered including '*Site*' as a random factor. The model was then simplified by  sequentially removing non-significant fixed effects (p ≥ 0.05), retaining only those variables essential for maintaining the model’s optimal fit (@zuur2011; see Supplementary Material B). 


Model selection was based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), with a decrease in ΔBIC ≥1 interpreted as a substantial improvement in model performance [@burnham2002]. Bayesian model weights (ranging from 0 to 1) were calculated to evaluate the relative plausibility of each candidate model. Nested models were compared using likelihood ratio test via ANOVA, incorporating corrections for testing on the boundary as recommended by @zuur2011. 


Following model selection, scaled residuals were computed and assessed for deviations from uniformity through visual inspection and formal goodness-of-fit test using simulated residuals in the ‘DHARMa’ package [@hartig2022]. To evaluate whether the abundance of chitons ('*Chitons*') was associated with fluorescent substrate coverage ('*Flu.cover*') on boulder sides, we fitted a zero-inflated Poisson generalized linear mixed model (ziGLMM Poisson), including ‘*Sites*’ as a random effect. A square root transformation was applied to the predictor to improve the model fit


To futher explore whether the observed effect reflected a species-specific relationship with distinct types of red crust algae ("hard" or "soft"), we constructed an alternative model using ‘*Live.cca*’ and ‘*Live.pey*’ as separate predictors. The final selected model was a zero-inflated Negative Binomial GLMM (ziGLMM Negative Binomial), which best accommodated overdispersion in the data. All statistical analyses were conducted in R (R Development Core Team, 2024), with GLMM models fitted using the glmmTMB package [@brooks2017].


# Results

## General characterization and comparison among reefs

A total of 137 chitons were recorded, with adults comprising 95.6% (n=131) of the regional population. Juvenile chitons, 1°-5° developmental stage (Jardim, 2015), accounted for 4.4% (n=6), resulting in a ratio of one juvenile every 20 adults. Chitons occupied 36.6% (n=44) of the boulders sampled, with an encounter rate of approximately nine chitons per hour. During sampling, only eight individuals were observed active on the side of the boulders. At the reef scale, Búzios showed a significantly higher chiton abundance compared to other locations (p<0.01, KW test), with an average density of 3.60 chitons per boulder (Table 1). Significant variation was observed in water levels (mean $\pm$ SD: 37.9 $\pm$ 31.8 cm, p<0.01, KW test) and water temperature (30.7 $\pm$ 1.5 °C, p<0.01, KW test). The boulders had an average weight of 7.0 $\pm$ 6.3 kg, ranging from 1.5 to 25 kg, with no significant weight differences across reefs (p=0.53, KW test). Similarly, estimated surfaces areas showed consistent values across reefs (267 $\pm$ 144 cm^2^, p=0.70, KW test).

TABLE 1

The exposed surface area of the boulder sides averaged 222 $\pm$ 121 cm^2^, with a range of 60.78 to 698.36 cm^2^. No significant differences were observed among reefs (p=0.44, KW test). On average, the exposed side surfaces consisted of 54.11 $\pm$ 20.19% fluorescent substrates, 31.83 $\pm$ 18.29% non-fluorescent substrates, 12.10 $\pm$ 12.07% animal coverage, and 1.96 $\pm$ 2.45% other components. Red-crusted algae were consistently present on the side faces of all sampled boulders, accounting 47.52 $\pm$ 21.39% crustose coralline algae (*Lithothamnium* sp.) and 6.59 $\pm$ 12.50% soft red-crusted algae (*Peyssonnelia* sp.). Despite their lower coverage, soft red crusts were found on 66% of the boulder’s side faces (Supplementary Material A). Animal coverage was primarily composed of ascidians (5.79 $\pm$ 7.78%), sponges (2.83 $\pm$ 4.85%), and bryozoans (1.54 $\pm$ 4.14%). Among these, only bryozoans showed no significant differences among reefs (Table 2).


## Chitons abundance increases with fluorescent and bryozoans covers

Our best model reveals that chiton abundance significantly increases with higher percentages of fluorescent substrate on the sides of the boulders, regardless of reefs characteristics (Table 3). Specifically, chiton’s abundance increases at a rate of 0.02 chitons per percentage of fluorescent substrates (ziGLMM Poisson, z=3.11, SE=0.01, p=0.002, Figure 2). The square root of bryozoan cover was essential for maintaining the structure of the best-fitted model. However, its influence on chitons was interpreted with parsimony, as it was close to the significance threshold (ziGLMM Poisson, z=1.96, SE=0.11, p=0.049).


When assessing the species-specific relationship between chitons and red crust algae, algal cover did not predict a higher likelihood of chiton abundance on boulders. Instead, bryozoan cover emerged as the key predictor, showing a proportional linear increase in chiton abundance as bryozoan cover expanded on the boulder sides (Tabela 3). This relationship corresponds to a growth rate of 0.06 chitons per percentage increase of bryozoan cover (GLMM Negative Binomial, z=2.28, SE=0.03, p=0.022).


# Discussion

The Western Atlantic chiton, Ischnoplax pectinata, is a mollusk species with limited biological knowledge, typically found beneath boulders in the intertidal reefs of northeastern Brazil. Like other intertidal organisms, its activity seems to be influenced by tidal and non-tidal rhythms. Boulder chiton species are often observed crawling and feeding on the side surfaces of boulders during twilight (Glynn, 1970; Yoshioka and Fujitani, 2006; Aguilera and Navarete, 2012). However, I. pectinata stands apart, as its shells exhibit fluorescence when exposed to short-wavelength light, such as blue and UV light (Grimaldi et al., 2023). This phenomenon suggests that light interacts with their shell surfaces in ways that differ from typical reflection (Johnsen, 2011). Red crust algae are abundant along the edges of intertidal boulders (Liversage, 2016) and contain high concentrations of fluorescent pigments in their composition (Glazer, 1994). Although the chiton-red algae association is well-documented, most studies have primarily focused on their trophic relationships, leaving other aspects largely unexplored (Sigwart, 2018). Here, we propose that the relationship between I. pectinata and red crust algae may involve a visual component, potentially serving as camouflage against visually guided predators. Specifically, we hypothesize that I. pectinata is more abundant on boulders with greater coverage of fluorescent substrates on their sides. To test this, we constructed statistical models to analyze field ecological data, investigating whether chitons abundance correlates with the percentage of fluorescent substrate coverage on boulder sides and whether this relation is influenced by a species-specific effect of red crust algae. Our best-fitting model showed a clear positive association between chiton abundance and the level of fluorescent substrate coverage on boulder sides. Notably, bryozoan cover was a significant stabilizing predictor in the model that included fluorescent substrate coverage. It also emerged as the main predictor of chiton abundance in models evaluating the specific role of red crust algae, suggesting it may have a critical or complementary role.

Chitons species exhibit a wide range of feeding habits, including specialized strategies such as carnivory (McLean, 1962; Saito and Okutani, 1992), spongivory (Warrén2 and Klitgarrd, 1991), and xylophagy (Sirenko, 2004; Duperron et al., 2013). Despite this diversity, intertidal chitons are generally regarded as omnivorous browsers. Their gut contents often contain a diverse array of materials, including animals, plants, rock fragments, sand, and inorganic detritus (Demopulos, 1975; Fulton, 1975; Langer, 1978, 1983; Piercy, 1987; Camus, 2012). This broad range of ingested items is largely attributed to their feeding mechanism, which relies on a radula - a belt-like, muscular strap equipped with rows of iron oxide-mineralized teeth (Joester and Brooker 2016). This structure enables chitons to scrape and ingest materials indiscriminately, a process commonly referred to as ‘bulldozing’ (Smith and Otway, 1997; Liversage and Kotta, 2019). In the case of I. pectinata, its observed biofluorescence may result from the direct or accidental ingestion of red crustose algae, such as Lithothamnium spp. and Peyssonnelia spp. These algae are rich in phycobiliproteins, highly fluorescent compounds that might undergo biomineralization within the chiton's shell (Peebles et al., 2017). Although crustose coralline algae and bryozoans are frequently found in the diets of many chiton species (Nishi, 1975; Piercy, 1987; Gordon, 1972; Byrnes and Stachowicz, 2009), it is possible that chitons primarily target smaller associated organisms, such as copepods, amphipods, or diatoms, which inhabit these substrates (Osman and Haugsness, 1981; Lidgard, 2008). To better understand the feeding ecology of I. pectinata, examining its intestinal and radula morphology may provide more definitive insights than stomach/ gut content analysis alone (Sigwart and Schwabe, 2017).

Our model achieves the best fit when accounting for the combined role of red crustose algae as fluorescent substrates, rather than considering isolated effects. This highlights the potential importance of visual aspects of the habitat in determining the spatial distribution of chitons, which are highly light-sensitive organisms (Li et al., 2015). Chitons larvae, known as trochophores, develop functional eyes within three day of age (Sirenko, 2018), enabling them to detect and respond to visual cue in their environment. Laboratory experiments have shown that trochophore larvae actively select settlement site on crustose coralline algae (Barnes and Gonor, 1973; Rumrill and Cameron, 1983) or colonies of bryozoans (Creese, 1986). At finer spatial scales, visual cues may play a more significant role than chemical ones in guiding larval settlement (Ambrose, 2021). In particular, fluorescence can amplify the visual intensity of a surface, making more attracting to positive photosensitive larvae (Matsumura and Qian, 2014). Like many animals with planktonic larvae, this light sensitivity response undergoes ontogenetic changes (Marshall et al., 1999). For example, the boulder chiton Ischnochiton magdallensis undergoes a shift in phototropism during its life cycle: larvae are positive phototropic, whereas adults exhibit negative phototropism (Arey and Crozier, 1919). This transition reflects the differing visual requirements between planktonic larvae stage and their adult niche, often demanding substantial optical reorganization (Cronin et al., 2014). Our observations indicate potential differentiation in habitat use between life stages, as juveniles were rarely found sharing boulders with adults. This pattern suggests an ontogenetic niche shift, possibly driven by reproductive needs or predator avoidance (Sánchez-Hernández et al., 2019). A long-term population study could provide valuable insights into the ecological trade-offs associated with these shifts across ontogeny and seasonal cycles.

Boulder reefs are typically characterized by habitat specialist species that are patchily distributed across the reef landscape (Smith and Otway, 1997; Chapman, 2005). These organisms often exhibit aggregated spatial distributions, with large numbers occupying some boulders while others remain unoccupied (Grayson and Chapman, 2004; Palmer, 2012; Chapman, 2002; Smoothey, 2007). Research on boulder reefs has primarily focused on the lower and upper surfaces of individual boulder, while the sides remain understudied (Kangas and Shepherd, 1984; Chapman, 2005; Liversage et al., 2012; Liversage & Kotta, 2015). However, mobile benthic species utilize boulder habitats in a three-dimensional manner, moving across various surfaces (Evans, 1951; Wells, 1980). For instance, boulder chitons emerge at specific times of the day to feed on the sides of boulders (Liversage and Benkendorff, 2017). Our study quantified the environmental and biological factors influencing chiton abundance on the sides of boulders. The observed positive relationship with fluorescent substrates and bryozoan coverage suggests that these factors may act as biological facilitators, enhancing habitat suitability. They likely aid chitons in detecting optimal settlement sites or provide ecological benefits such as camouflage, food resources, or microhabitats that support their survival. These finding highlight the intricate dynamics of boulder reef ecosystems, where ecological interactions among organisms significantly influence community structure. In this context, chitons, as mobile benthic grazers, play a vital role in sustaining ecological balance. Their movement among boulders and daily activity may support the health and resilience of these ecosystems in the face of disturbances. Future research should explore how these patterns affect broader community interactions and contribute to the long-term stability and functionality of reef habitats.

The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report confirms with “high confidence” that seawater pH has decreased globally over the past 40 years, signaling ongoing process of ocean acidification (IPCC, 2023). This phenomzenon is driven by the absorption of atmospheric CO2, which alters seawater chemistry and reduce the saturation state of calcium carbonate – a critical component for the skeletons and shells of many marine organisms (Jones et al., 2017; Osborne et al., 2020). Ocean acidification could affect biomineralizing organisms on boulder reef differently, with some being more vulnerable than others. Crustose coralline algae, for instance, are particularly susceptible to these changes (Kamenos et al., 2016), while other lineages, such as Peyssonelia and bryozoans, have demonstrated adaptative responses (Linares et al., 2015; Swezey et al., 2017). Chitons is a group of mollusks that has persisted through significant environmental changes throughout Earth’s history (Sigwart and Carey, 2014). Experiments reveal that their shell valves are exceptionally resilient to acidification (Sigwart et al., 2015; Peebles and Smith, 2019). However, modern global changes pose challenges that extend beyond ocean acidification and rising temperature. Factors such as hypoxia in coastal habitats (Melzner et al., 2013), declining food availability (Thomsen et al., 2013), and an increase in storm frequency and intensity (IPCC, 2023) threaten to disrupt coastal ecosystems. These disturbances are particularly significant for intertidal zones, where altered hydrodynamics can reshape the disturbance regimes affecting habitat stability. Boulder reefs are particularly to these disturbances due their inherently unstable structure. They are frequently subjected to wave action, sand abrasion, and collision with logs, driftwood, artificial debris or among boulders, resulting in substantial physical damage. These stressors may interact with broader climate-driven changes, creating diverse and unpredictable effects at multiple ecological scales. The resulting pressures can influence not only the survival of individuals organisms but also the balance of ecological interaction within these habitats. 

Boulder reefs are highly complex and dynamic ecosystems, characterized by their inherent instability and intricate ecological interactions. Understanding the relationships that underspin these environments is crucial for predicting how they will respond to future scenarios of global change. In this study, we investigated a biofluorescent chiton species and its association with substrate coverage on the sides of its boulder habitats. Our find reveals a direct correlation between chiton abundance and the coverage of fluorescent substrates and bryozoans. Furthermore, we explore the possibility that the chiton-red crust algae association extends beyond a simple trophic interaction, potentially involving visual aspects enhanced by fluorescence. Fluorescence may play a critical role in communication, habitat selection, and predator-prey dynamics, suggesting it could have significant ecological implications. Investigating how these visual processes are shaped by environmental changes provides valuable insights into the broader ecological consequences of global change. By exploring these connections, researchers can uncover how climate-induced disruptions shape the structure and resilience of boulder reef ecosystems, offering guidance for their conservation in an era of rapid change.

Figure 1: Study localities in northern Brazil. At each site, an equal number of samples (circles) were randomly distributed across the boulder zones of intertidal reefs, recording the presence (red) or absence (white) of chitons of each boulder.


Figure 2: Predicted chiton abundance as a function of fluorescent substrate cover (%). The blue line shows model predictions, the shaded area represents the 95% confidence interval, and gray dots indicate observed data. The model suggests a positive association, with abundance increasing at higher cover levels.

Table 2: Results from Dunn’s Kruskal-Wallis Multiple comparison post-hoc test with Bonferroni correction. Site sharing the same letter are not significantly different (p<0.05).


Table 3: Model selection results for chiton populations on boulders. Generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) were used to analyze the relationship between chitons abundance and substrate coverage percentages on the boulder’s sides, with separate considerations for fluorescent substrates and red crust algae. Models are ranked according to their ΔBIC value. Models in bold are the best fit.
