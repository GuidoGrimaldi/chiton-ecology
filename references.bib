In these experiments, the larvae would settle only on pieces of encrusting coralline algae and pieces of ceramic roofing tile soaked in a coralline algal extract. The settling stimulus is probably chemical in nature, and is inactivated by boiling. In laboratory cultures, normal development stops at the trochophore stage (110 to 160 h, depending on the temperature). Metamorphosis and further development will take place only after settlement on encrusting coralline algae.},

  abstract = {Photophysical investigations of the canonical nucleobases that make up DNA and RNA during the past 15 years have revealed that excited states formed by the absorption of UV radiation decay with subpicosecond lifetimes (i.e., {$<$}10-12 s). Ultrashort lifetimes are a general property of absorbing sunscreen molecules, suggesting that the nucleobases are molecular survivors of a harsh UV environment. Encoding the genome using photostable building blocks is an elegant solution to the threat of photochemical damage. Ultrafast excited-state deactivation strongly supports the hypothesis that UV radiation played a major role in shaping molecular inventories on the early Earth before the emergence of life and the subsequent development of a protective ozone shield. Here, we review the general physical and chemical principles that underlie the photostability, or ``UV hardiness'', of modern nucleic acids and discuss the possible implications of these findings for prebiotic chemical evolution. In RNA and DNA strands, much longer-lived excited states are observed, which at first glance appear to increase the risk of photochemistry. It is proposed that the dramatically different photoproperties that emerge from assemblies of photostable building blocks may explain the transition from a world of molecular survival to a world in which energy-rich excited electronic states were eventually tamed for biological purposes such as energy transduction, signaling, and repair of the genetic machinery.},

  abstract = {Biofluorescence, the ability to exploit light with short wavelengths, such as ultraviolet (UV) and blue, and re-emit it with lower energy and longer wavelengths, is considered a widespread phenomenon among marine animals and has many ecological roles in intra- and interspecific communication. Heterobranch sea slugs are believed to rely almost exclusively on their colour patterns for survival, with coloration serving as camouflage or as a warning to predators of heterobranch toxicity (aposematic coloration). Since solar light is progressively absorbed by seawater with a constant loss of longer wavelengths, it is unclear how heterobranch coloration can maintain its ecological role below the water surface. The present study investigates, for the first time, in situ biofluorescence in 53 species of Mediterranean Heterobranchia to determine whether these animals rely on light emission to enhance the visibility of their colour patterns. The ability to fluoresce when illuminated by UV and blue light (wavelengths {$<$}470 nm) appeared to be quite widespread among nudibranchs (i.e. found in c. one-third of the encountered species), while no evidence of light emission was found in non-nudibranch heterobranchs. The majority of fluorescent species were Cladobranchia belonging to the superfamilies Fionoidea and Aeolidioidea. Nudibranchs fluoresced in four different colours, with green being the most common. Light emission was often restricted to particular body regions, such as the cerata of Cladobranchia. These preliminary data might indicate that fluorescence plays an essential role in the enhancement of nudibranch aposematic coloration.},

While traveling across different latitudes and longitudes, at the pace exceeding the earth's movement, the changes in the external cues exceed the level of toleration of the body's biological clock. This poses an alteration in our physiological activities of sleep--wake pattern, mental alertness, organ movement, and eating habits, causing them to temporarily lose the track of time. This is further re-synchronized with the physiological cues of the destination over time. The mechanism of resetting of the clocks with varying time zones and cues occur in organisms from bacteria to humans. It is the result of the evolution of different pathways and molecular mechanisms over the time. There has been evolution of numerous comprehensive mechanisms using various research tools to get a deeper insight into the rapid turnover of molecular mechanisms in various species. This review reports insights into the evolution of the circadian mechanism and its evolutionary shift which is vital and plays a major role in assisting different organisms to adapt in different zones and controls their internal biological clocks with changing external cues.},

  abstract = {Photosynthesis in plants is a very complicated process, utilizing two photosystems in series to carry out the very energy-demanding process of oxidizing water to molecular oxygen and reducing carbon dioxide to organic compounds. The process of carbon dioxide assimilation, today taking place mainly in conjunction with photosynthesis, appears to be even older than photosynthesis itself. The first photosynthetic organisms, living more than 3.4, perhaps even 3.8 Ga (Ga = gigayears = thousand million years) ago, carried out a simpler process than that observed in plants and likely did not result in oxygen production and only utilized one type of photosystem. A great variety of such one-photosystem photosynthesizers are living even today, and by comparing them, and from chemical fossils, researchers are trying to piece together a picture of the course of the earliest evolution of photosynthesis. Chlorophyll a may have preceded bacteriochlorophyll a as a main pigment for conversion of light into life energy. Oxygenic photosynthesis, i.e., photosynthetic production of molecular oxygen, first appeared in ancestors of present-day cyanobacteria more than 2.7, perhaps already 3.7 Ga ago. Cyanobacteria entered into close association with other organisms more than 1.2 Ga ago. There are indications that chloroplasts in green algae and green plants as well as those in glaucophytes and algae on the ``red'' line of evolution (red algae, cryptophytes, diatoms, brown algae, yellow-green algae, and others) originated from a single early event of endosymbiotic uptake of a cyanobacterium into a heterotrophic organism. A single event of secondary endosymbiosis, in which a red algal-like organism was taken up into another eukaryote, resulted in the diversity of organisms in the ``red line'' of algae that is also extended by tertiary (third level) endosymbiotic events. At the end of this chapter, a brief review is given of the evolution of the assimilation of carbon dioxide, the adaptation to terrestrial life, and the impact of photosynthesis on the terrestrial environment.},

Under-canopy models precisely estimate the availability of wavelengths of light spatially distributed under the canopy of stands: however these models require a large amount of data on the spatial structure of forest stands. The other class of models describes the light conditions on a particular open surface. These incorporate shielding from the side and are easier to use as they require less data than under-canopy models. In practice, in forest conditions, such models require data on the size, shape, and geographical location of surveyed surfaces (e.g. gaps, and cut areas) and on the height of the surrounding stand. Often, these data are available in databases, such as the State Forest Information System (SILP), can otherwise be obtained relatively easily (and inexpensively). Compared to under-canopy models, these models provide a cheap way to obtain useful information on variation in the light environment that affects the microclimate for regenerating plants on clearcuts and canopy gaps.},

In this study, we examined the external fluorescence and the fluorophores of different sexes and life stages of the crab spider Misumena vatia (Clerk 1757), a sit-and-wait predator that feeds on insects as they visit flowers. We designed novel instrumentation to measure external fluorescence in whole specimens. We found that although males and females possess internal fluorophores with similar properties, the external expression of fluorescence varies across sexes and life stages. Spiders fluoresce brightly as immatures. Females maintain their brightness to adulthood, whereas males become increasingly dim as they mature. We suggest that external fluorescence likely contributes to visual signaling in these animals, and that it differs between the sexes as a result of differences in foraging ecology and behavior.},

  abstract = {Several recent reviews highlight the molecular mechanisms that underpin phenological responses to temperature and photoperiod; however, these have mostly overlooked the influence of solar radiation and its spectral composition on these processes. For instance, solar radiation in the blue and ultraviolet (UV) regions of the spectrum, as well as the red/far-red (R:FR) ratio, can influence spring and autumn phenology. Solar radiation reaching the Earth changes diurnally and seasonally; however, rising global temperatures, latitudinal range shifts and light pollution are likely to produce novel combinations of phenological cues for tree species. Here, we review the literature on phenological responses to spectral composition. Our objective was to explore the natural variation in spectral composition using radiative transfer models and to reveal any species-specific or ecotype-specific responses relating to latitudinal origin. These responses are likely to be most pronounced at high latitudes where spectral composition varies most throughout the year. For instance, trees from high latitudes tend to be more sensitive to changes in R:FR than those from low latitudes. The effects of blue light and UV radiation on phenology have not been studied as much as those of R:FR, but the limited results available suggest both could be candidate cues affecting autumn leaf colouration and senescence. Failure of more--southern species and ecotypes to adapt and use spectral cues during northwards range shifts could result in mistimed phenology, potentially resulting in frost damage, reduced fitness and limited range expansion. Future areas for research should look to establish how consistently different functional types of tree respond to spectral cues and identify photoreceptor-mediated mechanisms that allow plants to combine information from multiple light cues to coordinate the timing of phenological events. It should then be feasible to consider the synchronous or sequential action of light cues within a hierarchy of environmental factors regulating phenology.},

Such is the case of Acanthopleura echinata (Barnes), one of the largest and most conspicuous chitons in the world, and at the same time, one of the least known intertidal species in the southeastern Pacific. To improve the basic ecological knowledge of this potentially important intertidal consumer, we studied the diet of A. echinata and its variation among sites of varying levels of coastal upwelling spread over 1000 km along the coast of northern Chile. A seasonal evaluation of diet, body size distribution and density at sites expected to vary in overall nutrient loadings, benthic algal productivity and sea surface temperature, allowed us to examine plasticity in Acantholeura diet and body size. Overall, A. echinata consumed 85 items of algae (64.7 \%, mainly fleshy and calcified encrusting thalli) and invertebrates (35.3 \%, mainly barnacles). Diet was always dominated by encrusting corallines, although the proportion of algae increased with body size suggesting an ontogenetic variation in feeding habits. Although the number and occurrence frequency of dietary items varied significantly in time and space, there were no consistent seasonal patterns and the dominant items in the diet remained the same at all places. The density of A. echinata showed no significant spatial variation, but its body size and diet breadth correlated positively among sites and both tended to increase with latitude. Our results show that A. echinata is a generalist, polyphagous consumer with a high potential for affecting the space-occupancy dynamics in the intertidal system, and also that among site variation in diet bears no simple relationship with variation in sea surface temperature and upwelling intensity.},

This study describes experiments in which quarried stones were used to create new habitat outside natural boulder-fields as a practical approach to restoring habitat. Colonization by specialist fauna and by common algae and invertebrates was measured for a year after deployment. Despite sessile assemblages on new boulders differing from those on natural boulders, common and rare animals rapidly colonized the new habitat. There was no clear succession, but colonization was variable and patchy at all scales examined, although diversities and abundances of some species in this novel habitat matched those of natural boulders within a few months. Rare and common animals generally colonized the new habitat as adults moving in from surrounding areas. Creating new boulder-fields using quarried rocks is a successful approach to restoration and conservation of fauna where natural boulder-fields are threatened.},

As in other animals with distributed visual systems, we still have a poor understanding of the visual capabilities of A. granulata and we have yet to learn where and how it processes visual information. Using behavioral trials involving isoluminant looming visual stimuli, we found that A. granulata demonstrates spatial vision with an angular resolution of 6 deg. We also found that A. granulata responds to looming stimuli defined by contrasting angles of linear polarization. To learn where and how A. granulata processes visual information, we traced optic nerves using fluorescent lipophilic dyes. We found that the optic nerves innervate the underlying lateral neuropil, a neural tissue layer that circumnavigates the body. Adjacent optic nerves innervate the lateral neuropil with highly overlapping arborizations, suggesting it is the site of an integrated visuotopic map. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that the lateral neuropil of A. granulata is subdivided into two separate layers. In comparison, we found that a chiton with eyespots (Chiton tuberculatus) and two eyeless chitons (Ischnochiton papillosus and Chaetopleura apiculata) have lateral neuropil that is a singular circular layer without subdivision, findings consistent with previous work on chiton neuroanatomy. Overall, our results suggest that A. granulata effectuates its visually mediated behaviors using a unique processing scheme: it extracts spatial and polarization information using a distributed visual system, and then integrates and processes that information using decentralized neural circuits.},

  abstract = {Light is a critical factor in the proximate basis of diel vertical migration (DVM) in zooplankton. A photobehavioral approach was used to examine the spectral sensitivity of four coastal species of calanoid copepod, representing a diversity of DVM patterns, to test whether species that migrate (nocturnal or reverse DVM) have response spectra that differ from non-migratory surface dwellers. The following species were given light stimuli at wavelengths from 350 to 740 nm, and their photoresponses were measured: Centropages typicus (nocturnal migrator), Calanopia americana (nocturnal migrator), Anomalocera ornata (reverse migrator), and Labidocera aestiva (non-migrator). Centropages typicus and A. ornata had peak responses at 500 and 520 nm, respectively, while Calanopia americana had maximum responses at 480 and 520 nm. Thus, the species that undergo DVM have peak photobehavioral responses at wavelengths corresponding to those available during twilight in coastal water, although the range of wavelengths to which they respond is variable. Non-migratory surface-dwelling L. aestiva had numerous response peaks over a broad spectral range, which may serve to maximize photon capture for vision in their broad-spectrum shallow-water habitat.},

Weather has long been hypothesized to affect the timing and intensity of avian migration, and radar studies have demonstrated strong correlations between weather and broad-scale migration patterns. How weather affects individual decisions about the initiation of migratory flights, particularly at the beginning of migration, remains uncertain. Methods{\enspace} Here, we combine automated radio telemetry data from four species of songbirds collected at five breed-ing and wintering sites in North America with hourly weather data from a global weather model. We use these data to determine how wind profit, atmospheric pressure, precipitation, and cloud cover affect probability of departure from breeding and wintering sites. Results{\enspace} We found that the probability of departure was related to changes in atmospheric pressure, almost com-pletely regardless of species, season, or location. Individuals were more likely to depart on nights when atmospheric pressure had been rising over the past 24 h, which is predictive of fair weather over the next several days. By contrast, wind profit, precipitation, and cloud cover were each only informative predictors of departure probability in a single species. Conclusions{\enspace} Our results suggest that individual birds actively use weather information to inform decision-making regarding the initiation of departure from the breeding and wintering grounds. We propose that birds likely choose which date to depart on migration in a hierarchical fashion with weather not influencing decision-making until after the departure window has already been narrowed down by other ultimate and proximate factors.},

It is farmed under different conditions that translate to a great range of light environments, which impact their behavior and productivity. We present the first study employing both visual modeling and beha vioral data to evaluate the ontogenetic changes in color preferences of juveniles and adults of M. rosenbergii. We offered ten shelters of different colors to juveniles and adults and registered their preferences. Our results show that shelter preference changed with ontogeny: juveniles chose shelters based on chromaticity (preference for blue), while adults based their decisions on brightness (preference for dark grey). This preference adults show for dark colors is probably associated with light avoidance behavior. We recommend providing blue shelters for juveniles and dark shelters for adults.},

On exposed rock, A. garnoti was active only during nocturnal low tides, although some individuals were active during early morning low tides when in shade. Chitons from upper-shore pools were active during both day and night low tides. At all sites chitons foraged for longer ({\=x} = 5.5 h) and travelled further ({\=x} = 313 mm) during a spring tide new moon and least on a spring tide full moon ({\=x} = 4.0 h; {\=x} = 182 mm). Chitons on the boulder beach travelled greater distances ({\=x} = 367 mm) during foraging than those from aeolian shores ({\=x} = 105 mm). It is suggested that this is a result of boulder beach chitons having further to travel to find a grazing patch. Finally, A. garnoti was found to have a ranging pattern of activity on boulder shores and a homing pattern on aeolian shores.},

Featuring some 225 illustrations, including more than 140 in color, spread throughout the text, this comprehensive and accessible book begins by discussing the basic properties of light and the optical environment. It then looks at how photoreceptors intercept light and convert it to usable biological signals, how the pigments and cells of vision vary among animals, and how the properties of these components affect a given receptor's sensitivity to light. The book goes on to examine how eyes and photoreceptors become specialized for an array of visual tasks, such as navigation, evading prey, mate choice, and communication.A timely and much-needed resource for students and researchers alike, Visual Ecology also includes a glossary and a wealth of examples drawn from the full diversity of visual systems.The most up-to-date overview of visual ecology availableFeatures some 225 illustrations, including more than 140 in color, spread throughout the textGuides readers from the basic physics of light to the role of visual systems in animal behaviorIncludes a glossary and a wealth of real-world examples},

However, the contemporary study of camouflage extends beyond evolutionary biology, co-opting knowledge, theory and methods from sensory biology, perceptual and cognitive psychology, computational neuroscience and engineering. This is because camouflage is an adaptation to the perception and cognition of the species (one or more) from which concealment is sought. I review the different ways in which camouflage manipulates and deceives perceptual and cognitive mechanisms, identifying how, and where in the sequence of signal processing, strategies such as transparency, background matching, disruptive coloration, distraction marks, countershading and masquerade have their effects. As such, understanding how camouflage evolves and functions not only requires an understanding of animal sensation and cognition, it sheds light on perception in other species.},

The site is subjected to irregular sand fluctuations, as well as diurnal, neapspring and major summer sand intrusions. The abundance and distribution of intertidal species was interrelated with the historical sand fluctuations at the area. For example, the lower limits of Mytilus edulis, Balanus balanoides and Porphyra umbilicalis approximated the highest summer sand elevations. Highly abraded rock surfaces in the lower intertidal zone were dominated by opportunistic annuals (e.g. Enteromorpha spp.) and perennial psammophytic or sand-loving seaweeds (e.g. Ahnfeltia plicata and Sphacelaria radicans). Overall, the intertidal seaweed populations at Bound Rock showed a lower number of perennials and fewer species than adjacent rocky shores. The low species diversity of seaweeds at the study site is attributable to unstable environmental conditions and a limited number of habitats. Even so, several psammophytic microhabitats are evident at Bound Rock depending upon the extent of sand burial and abrasion. The morphological and reproductive adaptations of several psammophytic species are discussed.},

Currently, these effects are best understood for auditory and chemosensory modalities, and recent reviews highlight their importance for conservation. We examined how anthropogenic changes to the visual environment (ambient light, transmission, and backgrounds) affect visual communication and camouflage and considered the implications of these effects for conservation. Human changes to the visual environment can increase predation risk by affecting camouflage effectiveness, lead to maladaptive patterns of mate choice, and disrupt mutualistic interactions between pollinators and plants. Implications for conservation are particularly evident for disrupted camouflage due to its tight links with survival. The conservation importance of impaired visual communication is less documented. The effects of anthropogenic changes on visual communication and camouflage may be severe when they affect critical processes such as pollination or species recognition. However, when impaired mate choice does not lead to hybridization, the conservation consequences are less clear. We suggest that the demographic effects of human impacts on visual communication and camouflage will be particularly strong when human-induced modifications to the visual environment are evolutionarily novel (i.e., very different from natural variation); affected species and populations have low levels of intraspecific (genotypic and phenotypic) variation and behavioral, sensory, or physiological plasticity; and the processes affected are directly related to survival (camouflage), species recognition, or number of offspring produced, rather than offspring quality or attractiveness. Our findings suggest that anthropogenic effects on the visual environment may be of similar importance relative to conservation as anthropogenic effects on other sensory modalities.},

Call transmission is influenced by the acoustics of the propagation environment, including vegetation. Thus, forestry monocultures of non-native trees represent artificial environments that could modify call transmission. These monocultures have substituted large areas of Atlantic Forest in southern Brazil, representing a conservation challenge. Considering this context, we hypothesized that anurans have calls that are less attenuated in their native environment than in forest plantations. To test it, we performed sound transmission experiments using calls of three anuran species native to southern Brazil: Boana bischoffi, B. leptolineata, and Hylodes meridionalis. We compared sound attenuation between the native forest and forestry monocultures (Eucalyptus sp. and Pinus sp. forests), and included distance from the sound source, air temperature, humidity, and vegetation density as cofactors in linear mixed models. Our results show that the advertisement calls of the two tree frogs (Boana) attenuate less in tree plantations than in native forests, while the third species shows either no differences or less attenuation in native forests. Our results can be understood according to differences in natural history and microhabitat use among the studied species. The two tree frog species vocalize perched from vegetation so their calls become better transmitted in forestry monocultures, which have fewer trees than the native forest. On the other hand, H. meridionalis calls from rocks on streams and the propagation is finely tuned to this peculiar microhabitat. We discuss the conservation implications of our findings for anurans and for the Atlantic Forest. Abstract in Portuguese and Spanish are available with online material.},

We found that representatives of many scleractinian species are brightly fluorescent at depths of 50--60 m at the Interuniversity Institute for Marine Sciences (IUI) reef in Eilat, Israel. Some of these fluorescent species have distribution maxima at mesophotic depths (40--100 m). Several individuals from these depths displayed yellow or orange-red fluorescence, the latter being essentially absent in corals from the shallowest parts of this reef. We demonstrate experimentally that in some cases the production of fluorescent pigments is independent of the exposure to light; while in others, the fluorescence signature is altered or lost when the animals are kept in darkness. Furthermore, we show that green-to-red photoconversion of fluorescent pigments mediated by short-wavelength light can occur also at depths where ultraviolet wavelengths are absent from the underwater light field. Intraspecific colour polymorphisms regarding the colour of the tissue fluorescence, common among shallow water corals, were also observed for mesophotic species. Our results suggest that fluorescent pigments in mesophotic reefs fulfil a distinct biological function and offer promising application potential for coral-reef monitoring and biomedical imaging.},

  abstract = {The effects of the microtopography of the surface and the antifouling ability of crustose coralline alga on the recruitment of epiphytes were tested under different shading conditions. In experiments set up on the south coast of Isle of Man, British Isles, during autumn and winter, epiphyte settlement and survival on Phymatolithon lenormandii (Aresch) Adey and P. purpureum (P. \& H. Crouan) Woelkerling and Irvine were compared on epoxy replicas as well as dead and living crusts. Differences in the density of epiphyte germlings between replicas of the surface of two crust species were due to their surface textures. The rough-surfaced P. lenormandii had a higher density of epiphytes, probably because it provides a better refuge for Ulva and Enteromorpha spp. zoospores than for Fucus zygotes, which are larger and thus less protected by crust protuberances on wave washed shores. On the shore, shading with neutral roofs was less effective than canopy algae in cutting out light and suppressing Fucus germlings. Living crusts strongly retarded epiphyte recruitment, but this was dependent on light levels on the shore. The factors influencing this process need to be identified, because mechanical and chemical mechanisms cannot yet be distinguished.},

They recorded changes in the location and disposition of hundreds of clasts but were unable to trace the intermittent movement of individual boulders. Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) sensors were used in the present study to identify and record the long-term trajectories of boulders in this area. Sensors were installed in 80 boulders (mean intermediate axes approximately 55\,cm) in September 2016 and were used to locate and record their displacement on five occasions, terminating in December 2019. Although burial and other factors prevented data being collected from every tagged boulder during these periods, recovery rates ranged from approximately 50\%--75\% of the original population. There was considerable variability in the displacement of the boulders, with maxima of {$>$}20\,m and mean values {$>$}5\,m. The distance of travel tended to decrease during the course of this study, despite a corresponding increase in storm frequency and intensity. Patterns of movement, including transport distance and direction were essentially chaotic in nature, reflecting the complex interaction and compound effect of a multitude of controls related to such factors as the location of boulders on the beach, their relationship to surrounding boulders, including the effects of sheltering, interlocking, and burial, and their size, shape, and other physical characteristics. The unpredictable behaviour and high transport thresholds of boulder beaches are in contrast to sand and gravel beaches that are characterized by more uniform and predictable patterns of sediment transport and morphological change.},

  abstract = {The Ryukyu Islands, Japan, where numerous boulders are deposited on the reef and on land, might be ideal research fields of boulders deposited by tsunami and storm waves because many typhoons and several tsunamis attacked the same area during its history. This study investigates the size, position, and the long axis orientation of 626 boulders at Ibaruma and Shiraho Reefs at Ishigaki Island, Japan to elucidate the sedimentary differences of boulders deposited by tsunamis and storm waves in one area. Two distinct groups of boulders were found at these reefs: boulders on the reef crest (group 1) and along the shoreline (group 2). Boulders in group 1 ({$<$}47t) included reef and coral boulders originating from the reef slope and reef crest. They were deposited within a band from 50 to 210--240m from the reef edge with an exponentially fining landward trend. They were deposited within the transport limit of the storm waves at the Ryukyu Islands and were deposited at their present locations by storm waves, as inferred from aerial photographs. No boulders were observed on the reef crest from 210--240 to 350m from the reef edge, suggesting that no storm wave in the past (since the 1771 Meiwa Tsunami) had sufficient energy to displace large boulders more than 240m from the reef edge at eastern coast of Ishigaki Island. Boulders in group 2 include abundant microatoll-shaped large colonies of massive Porites sp. of moat origin. The group 2 boulders were remarkably heavier ({$<$}216t) than those in group 1. Boulders were scattered randomly along the shoreline, 390--1290m from the reef edge, which is far beyond the transport limit of boulders by the storm waves. Hydrodynamically, the source, size, and horizontal displacement distance of boulders in group 2 cannot be explained by storm wave action, which suggests their tsunami origin (probably 1771 Meiwa Tsunami according to 14C age). Based on results of this study, we infer that tsunami boulders in these islands, so-called "tsunami-ishi", can be discriminated from boulders of storm wave origin based on their sedimentary differences. This sedimentological approach is expected to be applicable to other boulder fields throughout the world. Our results further suggest that the spatial and grain size distribution of tsunami boulders are very useful to elucidate local flow characteristics of the tsunami. For example, the group 2 tsunami boulders were deposited below the high tide line irrespective of size. Some were split into several pieces. They were probably deposited below the high tide line by the remarkable reduction of the current velocity of the tsunami because of the local topography. The reduction of the current velocity must have been drastic to have made the boulders hit the ground with sufficient force to split them.},

  abstract = {Chitons of the genus Ischnochiton are found predominantly on the undersurfaces of boulders, compared with other intertidal or subtidal habitats. They therefore appear to be habitat-specialists at this scale. This, combined with the fact that boulder fields are relatively sparse compared with other intertidal habitats, makes these animals vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. In addition, many species of Ischnochiton are relatively rare and appear to have very patchy abundances, making them likely to have very specific requirements for habitat. We need to understand the habitat requirements in order to manage, conserve and restore disturbed habitats.The present study was carried out at three intertidal boulder fields separated along approximately 200 km of the coast of New South Wales, Australia, centred around Sydney. The boulder fields were representative of those found in this region. The boulders were made of different materials: shale in the north, sandstone in Sydney and quartzitic sandstone in the south. Some boulders in each boulder field were covered by up to 0.4 m of water during low tide. The study showed that the seven species examined were overdispersed among boulders in each of these three intertidal boulder fields. Most boulders did not have associated chitons, but there were very large abundances on a very small number of boulders. Chitons were also overdispersed among boulders that they occupied. These patterns were consistent among shores and among species, even though patterns of abundance were extremely different among different species. These species appear therefore to show specific requirements for habitat at a small spatial scale, using only a small proportion of potential patches of habitat (i.e. boulders) in any place. Extremely patchy patterns of dispersion can be caused by variation in patterns of recruitment, mortality or behavioural responses to habitat or other species. Before performing experiments to investigate such processes, it is useful to test hypotheses of association with habitat using mensurative experiments to identify environmental correlates that might explain the observed patterns. In the present study, sizes of boulders and the associated sessile and mobile assemblages were proposed as mechanisms that could affect dispersion of chitons among boulders. None of these factors, however, showed strong associations with abundances of chitons. The lack of support of these models rules out some features of habitat to which species of Ischnochiton might respond, thereby precluding manipulative experiments involving these features, which are unlikely to be involved in the very patchy patterns of dispersion of species of Ischnochiton.},

  abstract = {Biofluorescence is apparently widespread in the tree of life. Fluorescence has the potential to contribute to the totality of light leaving an organism's surface and will therefore circumscribe how an individual could be detected and discriminated by their visual predators. Here, we: (i) documented the first record of biofluorescence on polyplacophorans, (ii) spectrally characterized the biofluorescence on shells of living chitons, (iii) measured the colour patch pattern variation, (iv) separated the colour of their shells into their reflectance and fluorescence components, and (v) combined these data with field measurements to calculate perceptual distance in chromatic and achromatic contrasts based on the visual system of their major visually guided predators. We found a red biofluorescence that enhances the brightness of chiton shells, along with a correlation showing that as individuals grow larger, the fluorescing surface area becomes smaller. Our visual models suggest that fluorescence decreases the achromatic contrast of chitons against their naturally fluorescent substrates for most visual predators, making them less noticeable to specific predators. Our results support the potential visual functionality of biofluorescence and open new hypotheses regarding its ecological roles to further investigations.},

  abstract = {Although proteins in the green fluorescent protein family (GFPs) have been discovered in a wide array of taxa, their ecological functions in these organisms remain unclear. Many hypothesized roles are related to modifying bioluminescence spectra or modulating the light regime for algal symbionts, but these do not explain the presence of GFPs in animals that are non-luminous and non-symbiotic. Other hypothesized functions are unrelated to the visual signals themselves, including stress responses and antioxidant roles, but these cannot explain the localization of fluorescence in particular structures on the animals. Here we tested the hypothesis that fluorescence might serve to attract prey. In laboratory experiments, the predator was the hydromedusa Olindias formosus ( previously known as O. formosa), which has fluorescent and pigmented patches on the tips of its tentacles. The prey, juvenile rockfishes in the genus Sebastes, were significantly more attracted (P{$<$}1{\texttimes}10-5) to the medusa's tentacles under lighting conditions where fluorescence was excited and tentacle tips were visible above the background. The fish did not respond significantly when treatments did not include fluorescent structures or took place under yellow or white lights, which did not generate fluorescence visible above the ambient light. Furthermore, underwater observations of the behavior of fishes when presented with a brightly illuminated point showed a strong attraction to this visual stimulus. In situ observations also provided evidence for fluorescent lures as supernormal stimuli in several other marine animals, including the siphonophore Rhizophysa eysenhardti. Our results support the idea that fluorescent structures can serve as prey attractants, thus providing a potential function for GFPs and other fluorescent proteins in a diverse range of organisms.},

However, nursery habitat inference is complicated by changes in habitat preferences with ontogeny; individuals in early-life stages frequently inhabit different habitats than older juveniles or adults. In this field experiment, we modeled the density of 4 size classes of juvenile blue crabs Callinectes sapidus based on carapace width (CW) across multiple habitats at various locations within an estuarine seascape during the blue crab recruitment season. We examined 4 habitat types---unstructured sand, seagrass meadows, salt marsh edges (SME), and shallow detrital habitat (SDH). Results indicated that densities of small juvenile blue crabs ({$\leq$}10 mm CW) were highest in seagrass, whereas densities of larger juveniles (16-25 mm CW) were highest in SME. Although densities of juveniles declined in seagrass habitat as a function of size, densities in SME remained consistently high, suggesting that secondary dispersal to SME by smaller juveniles after settlement and recruitment in seagrass may supplement losses in SME due to mortality. Turbidity was positively correlated with densities of both size classes, although our model did not address whether this was due to top-down (refuge) or bottom-up (food availability) mechanisms. Observed patterns in size-specific habitat utilization may result from changing requirements of juvenile blue crabs with size, as animals minimize mortality-to-growth ratios. Our findings emphasize the role of both seagrass and salt marsh habitat within juvenile blue crab ontogeny and emphasize the significance of structurally complex SME habitat in supporting juvenile blue crabs at sizes smaller than previously recognized, challenging past notions about the singular importance of seagrass habitat in this system. Our findings also underscore the need to quantify and preserve the complete chain of habitats used by juveniles.},

Schwassmann this volume); in waters of varying quality for light transmission, different species of fishes may have eyes adapted morphologically and physiologically to perceive maximally in different parts of the visible spectrum (J. Lythgoe, this volume). This chapter on amphibians will compare and contrast the primary sensory modes (chemoreception, sound reception, photoreception) utilized by anurans and caudates. The modes emphasized by each Order are viewed as adaptations to several ecological constraints on information transmission. The constraints considered here are imposed by both the physical environment and by the number of species packed into a community.},

  abstract = {Biofluorescence is widely documented in marine organisms, yet few studies exist for decapods. After observing the king crab Paralithodes camtschaticus biofluoresces, we carried out studies on two separately maintained groups of male crabs under controlled conditions. Hyperspectral imaging on Group 1 (n = 18) examined the exoskeleton, whereas fluorospectrometry examined the hemolymph of Group 2 animals (n = 19). Both groups were investigated for fluorescence signals before and after exposure to a live shipping transportation simulation. The spines, chelae, eyestalks and cervical grooves of the cardiac region of P. camtschaticus fluoresce in the green spectra ({$\sim$}500 nm), while the arthrodial membranes of the joints fluoresce in the red spectrum ({$\sim$}680 nm). After the shipping simulation, we observed a significant decrease in fluorescence in the eyestalks (p = 0.009), while the cervical grooves showed a less significant change (p = 0.01). The hemolymph examined with 21 excitation wavelengths (250--350 nm) emitted fluorescence in {$\sim$}400--550 nm spectrum. We found a significant increase (p {$<$} 0.05) in fluorescence for 16 excitation wavelengths after transport simulation. The results presented in this study indicate that king crab fluorescence changes due to external stimuli. Fluorospectroscopy or hyperspectral imaging technology may serve as an effective early indicator of preclinical stress in these commercially important decapods.},

However, the effect of diet color over a short period on female preference for color-polymorphic male ornaments has not yet been investigated. In this study, we examined the effect of diet color on female preference for mate color in the guppy Poecilia reticulata, with color-polymorphic ornaments such as orange and black spots. From an early age, females were reared on a diet with orange and black color, respectively. A dichotomous mate choice experiment using females was conducted between males with large orange spots and males with large black spots. Females fed on an orange-colored diet preferred males with large orange spots, whereas those fed on a black-colored diet preferred males with large black spots. Afterward, the diet color treatment for the females was reversed for seven days. This dietary color alteration resulted in the reversal of female preference for male color. These results suggest that diet color has a great influence on female preference for mate color, even within a short period, and environmental gradients may function to maintain color-polymorphic male ornaments in this species.},

  abstract = {Ontogenetic niche shifts are taxonomically and ecologically widespread across the globe. Consequently, identifying the ecological mechanics that promote these shifts at diverse scales is central to an improved understanding of ecosystems generally. We evaluated multiple potential drivers of ontogenetic niche shifts (predation, growth, maturation, diet shifts, and food availability) for three fish species between connected coral reef and nearshore habitats. In all cases, neither diet compositional change nor sexual maturity functioned as apparent triggers for emigration from juvenile to adult habitats. Rather, the fitness advantages conferred on reef inhabitants (that is, enhanced growth rates) were primarily related to high prey availability on reefs. However, there exists a clear trade-off to this benefit as survival rates for small fishes were significantly reduced on reefs, thereby revealing the potential value of (and rationale behind high juvenile abundances in) nearshore habitat as predation refugia. We ultimately conclude that predation risk functions as the primary early life stage inhibitor of ontogenetic niche shifts towards more profitable adult habitats in these systems. Furthermore, this study provides a case study for how complex, meta-dynamic populations and ecosystems might be better understood through the elucidation of simple ecological trade-offs.},

  abstract = {Models of larval dispersal rarely incorporate the behavior of larvae, yet many potential settlers of marine invertebrates and fishes may navigate toward suitable settlement sites by responding to gradients of environmental stimuli. Accordingly, a variety of stimuli may be used for navigation (directed movements to the source of stimuli) and partial navigation (e.g., migration to a current that may favor transport to a settlement site) in the pelagic environment. A broad diversity of taxa have senses that allow them to detect variation in: water chemistry (biotic sources, e.g., amino acids and abiotic sources, e.g., salinity), sound and vibration (biotic sources, e.g., grunting fishes, abiotic sources, e.g., waves breaking), white light gradients and images, polarized light, current direction, magnetism and water pressure. Some organisms can detect multiple stimuli (e.g., decapods and fishes) and integrated sensory responses are likely to be common; many potential settlers of these taxa are good swimmers. Demonstrations of strong orientation to stimuli and navigation over short (centimeters to meters) and broad spatial scales (tens of meters to tens of kilometers) are most common for these groups. Partial navigation, involving vertical migration, is common for invertebrate larvae. A consequence of vertical migration can be transportation that favors movement to suitable settlement habitat. Navigation over a range of spatial scales may use stimuli that are very predictable regardless of location (e.g., water pressure, gravity). The gradients of other stimuli may be more useful for environment-specific signals and even the location of natal habitats, locations and conspecifics (e.g., using sound or smell of specific taxa). We argue that some larvae may use a hierarchy of sensory cues to find suitable settlement sites and that some of the same types of stimuli may be used at more than one spatial scale (as demonstrated for adult salmonid fishes). There are good demonstrations of the use of cues for orientation and navigation at small spatial scales (less than a few meters). More information, however, is required at spatial scales that are relevant to navigation over kilometers before behavior can be incorporated more accurately into models of larval dispersal.},

  abstract = {The vibrant colors of many birds' eggs, particularly those that are blue to blue-green, are extraordinary in that they are striking traits present in hundreds of species that have nevertheless eluded evolutionary functional explanation. We propose that egg pigmentation mediates a trade-off between two routes by which solar radiation can harm bird embryos: transmittance through the eggshell and overheating through absorbance. We quantitatively test four components of this hypothesis on variably colored eggs of the village weaverbird (Ploceus cucullatus) in a controlled light environment: (1) damaging ultraviolet radiation can transmit through bird eggshells, (2) infrared radiation at natural intensities can heat the interior of eggs, (3) more intense egg coloration decreases light transmittance (``pigment as parasol''), and (4) more intense egg coloration increases absorbance of light by the eggshell and heats the egg interior (``dark car effect''). Results support all of these predictions. Thus, in sunlit nesting environments, less pigmentation will increase the detrimental effect of transmittance, but more pigmentation will increase the detrimental effect of absorbance. The optimal pigmentation level for a bird egg in a given light environment, all other things being equal, will depend on the balance between light transmittance and absorbance in relation to embryo fitness.},

Until now, the field has focused on evaluating the relative importance of distinct processes, with niche-based environmental sorting on one side and neutral-based ecological drift and dispersal limitation on the other. This book moves beyond these artificial categorizations, showing how environmental sorting, dispersal, ecological drift, and other processes influence metacommunity structure simultaneously. Mathew Leibold and Jonathan Chase argue that the relative importance of these processes depends on the characteristics of the organisms, the strengths and types of their interactions, the degree of habitat heterogeneity, the rates of dispersal, and the scale at which the system is observed. Using this synthetic perspective, they explore metacommunity patterns in time and space, including patterns of coexistence, distribution, and diversity. Leibold and Chase demonstrate how these processes and patterns are altered by micro- and macroevolution, traits and phylogenetic relationships, and food web interactions. They then use this scale-explicit perspective to illustrate how metacommunity processes are essential for understanding macroecological and biogeographical patterns as well as ecosystem-level processes. Moving seamlessly across scales and subdisciplines, Metacommunity Ecology is an invaluable reference, one that offers a more integrated approach to ecological patterns and processes.},

We use optical experiments to demonstrate that these microscopic lenses are able to form images. Light scattering by the polycrystalline lenses is minimized by the use of relatively large, crystallographically-aligned grains. Multi-scale mechanical testing reveals that as the size, complexity, and functionality of the integrated sensory elements increases, the local mechanical performance of the armor decreases. However, A. granulata has evolved several strategies to compensate for its mechanical vulnerabilities to form a multi-purpose system with cooptimized optical and structural functions.},

  abstract = {Extreme storm events in coastal zones play significant roles in shaping the morphology of boulder beaches. However, boulder displacement and the geomorphological evolution of boulder beaches driven by different extreme storm events, especially typhoon events, remain poorly understood. Thus, boulder displacement and the geomorphic response on a boulder beach in Fujian, southeastern China, were explored before, during and after a cold wave event (Dec. 1--7, 2020) and before and after Typhoon In-Fa (Jul. 19--27, 2021), a large tropical storm. This was achieved by tracking 42 tagged boulders distributed in the intertidal and supratidal zones using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and topographic surveys using real-time kinematic techniques, respectively. The results showed obvious disparities in boulder displacement in different geomorphic zones due to cold wave and typhoon events that were mainly characterized by migration magnitude, range, direction, and mode of transport. The typhoon event led to rapid and substantial changes in the overall morphology of the boulder beach, while the cold wave event impacted the intertidal morphology of the boulder beach to only a small extent. The surrounding structure of boulders, beach slope and beach elevation had a combined dominant effect on boulder displacement under the same extreme event. Hydrodynamic factors (effective wave energy fluxes, incident wave direction, storm surge and water level) had dominant effects on boulder displacement during different extreme events. In terms of a single event, the magnitude of the boulder displacement driven by the typhoon was much greater than that driven by the cold wave. However, considering the frequency and duration of cold waves in winter, the impact of multiple consecutive cold waves on the geomorphology of the boulder beach cannot be ignored in this study area. Alternating and repeated interactions between these two processes constitute the complete geomorphic evolution of the boulder beach. This study contributes to improved predictions of the morphodynamic response of boulder beaches to future storms, especially large tropical storms, and facilitates better coastal management.},

  abstract = {The intimate association between a selective herbivore (the chiton Choneplax lata) and its primary prey (the crustose coralline alga Porolithon pachydermum) results in increased biomass and accretion of the alga. This process, over ecological and geological time scales, comprises a major component of Caribbean reef-building systems. Manipulative experiments showed that as the chiton grazes the alga it stimulates new meristematic activity and removes sporlings of the competitively superior frondose and filamentous algae, thereby increasing the survival rate of P. pachydermum on the intertidal reef crest. Furthermore, in the absence of C. lata, overgrowths of frondose and filamentous epiphytes provide an attractive food source for parrotfishes (Scaridae), which accelerates bioerosion of the coralline reef-crest structure due to the deep rasping action of feeding activity. Algal removal experiments suggest that the role of P. pachydermum is to provide a predictable food source and refuge substratum, which increases survivorship of the burrowing chiton by minimizing expenditure of energy during foraging and risk to predation. The chiton/coralline alga association is abundant throughout tropical western Atlantic islands and augments reef-building processes on the shallow algal crest portion of Caribbean reefs. Cover of the Choneplax/Porolithon association in the Belize Barrier Reef crest averages 13\% (maximum to 70\%) with a mean chiton density of 664 individuals/m2 within the association. On average, the extensive networks of interconnected chiton burrows extend between 6 and 10 cm deep and contain one C. lata for every six openings, with the majority of animals (66\%) ranging from 16 to 30 mm in length. Gut contents of the chiton consist predominantly of P. pachydermum (51\%), followed by bacterial detritus (30\%), Cyanophyta (13\%), Bacillariophyta (3\%), and fleshy microalgae (3\%). The close SEM (scanning electron microscope) match between radular morphology of C. lata and grazing scars on the thallus surface of P. pachydermum shows how the chiton regularly feeds on the coralline alga without causing mortality. Virtually all P. pachydermum in the vicinity of C. lata burrows contain radular track scars of 10 JImin depth, whereas the photosynthetic, meristematic, and reproductive tissues of the coralline lie below 20 KIm.P. pachydermum under intense chiton grazing is photosynthetically competent with 0.1 mg C fixed {$\cdot$} g-{\textasciitilde} organic dry mass-h-1, which is not significantly different from ungrazed material and within the range of rates for other crustose coralline algae. The result is continuous net accretion at a mean rate of 2.3 mm/yr.},

We used micro-computed tomography combined with quantitative image analysis to reveal the optimized shell geometry to resist force and the aesthetes' global distribution at the whole animal levels to facilitate sense from diverse directions both in the seawater and air. Additionally, shell proteomics combined with transcriptome reveals shell matrix proteins responsible for shell construction and potentially sensory function, highlighting unique cadherin-related proteins among mollusca.

The distance that CCA extends from the edge of boulders toward the centre of the underside was measured, and it was found that CCA extended further underneath boulders that were round-shaped compared with those that were block-shaped, probably because of light reaching further underneath round boulders. This result shows how at least one important taxon can be affected by variation in the shape of these boulders. Hypotheses being tested that use artificial substrata to model naturally occurring boulders should be carried out only in places where the artificial and naturally occurring boulders match physically.},

In the present study we measured among-boulder distributional patterns of Ischnochiton smaragdinus, and used time-lapse photography to quantify movement behaviours within different habitat types (pebble substrata and rock-platform). In intertidal rock-pools in South Australia, I. smaragdinus were significantly overdispersed among boulders, as most boulders had few individuals but a small proportion harboured large populations. I. smaragdinus individuals emerge from underneath boulders during nocturnal low-tides and move amongst the inter-boulder matrix (pebbles or rock-platform). Seventy-two percent of chitons in the pebble matrix did not move from one pebble to another within the periods of observation (55--130 min) but a small proportion moved across as many as five pebbles per hour, indicating a capacity for adults to migrate among disconnected habitat patches. Chitons moved faster and movement paths were less tortuous across rock-platform compared to pebble substrata, which included more discontinuities among substratum patches. Overall, we show that patterns of distribution at the boulder-scale, such as the observed overdispersion, must be set largely by active dispersal of adults across the substratum, and that differing substratum-types may affect the degree of adult dispersal for this and possibly other under-boulder chiton species.},

  abstract = {The critical threshold mass for boulders composing a beach is the mass of the largest stone entrained by the hydraulic forces associated with wave breaking and swash run-up. For any given storm event there is a maximum boulder mass that can be moved and another slightly larger boulder that has the minimum mass necessary to remain stable. Two equations are derived: one to estimate critical threshold mass and another to estimate minimum stable mass for boulders on a beach. The equations incorporate: stone density, beach slope, breaking wave height, water depth, wave period, run-up height, maximum swash velocity and average swash velocity. In both equations the wave force applied to the beach face is scaled relative to the elevation that wave energy raises the water surface. Scaling the wave force relative to the run-up elevation results in a critical threshold formula. This is given as equation (45). Its predictions accurately match field data giving the largest boulder transported on a beach during storm events. Scaling the wave force relative to the breaking wave height at the toe of the beach results in a stability formula. This is given as equation (46). It predicts stable mass in the range defined by the Hudson formula. Equation (46) has an advantage over the Hudson formula by incorporating the physically important parameters of wave period and swash velocity. Both equations could be useful in the initial evaluation and design of dynamic revetments constructed with quarry stone.},

  abstract = {Green fluorescence is a common phenomenon in marine invertebrates and is caused by green fluorescent proteins. Many hydrozoan species display fluorescence in their polyps and/or medusa stages, and in a few cases patterns of green fluorescence have been demonstrated to differ between closely related species. Hydrozoans are often characterized by the presence of cryptic species, due to the paucity of available morphological diagnostic characters. Zanclea species are not an exception, showing high genetic divergence compared to a uniform morphology. In this work, the presence of green fluorescence and the morpho-molecular diversity of six coral- and bryozoan-associated Zanclea species from the Maldivian coral reefs were investigated. Specifically, the presence of green fluorescence in polyps and newly released medusae was explored, the general morphology, as well as the cnidome and the interaction with the hosts, were characterized, and the 16S rRNA region was sequenced and analyzed. Overall, Zanclea species showed a similar morphology, with little differences in the general morphological features and in the cnidome. Three of the analyzed species did not show any fluorescence in both life stages. Three other Zanclea species, including two coral-associated cryptic species, were distinguished by species-specific fluorescence patterns in the medusae. Altogether, the results confirmed the morphological similarity despite high genetic divergence in Zanclea species and indicated that fluorescence patterns may be a promising tool in further discriminating closely related and cryptic species. Therefore, the assessment of fluorescence at a large scale in the whole Zancleidae family may be useful to shed light on the diversity of this enigmatic taxon.},

  abstract = {A central focus of population ecology is understanding what factors explain the distribution and abundance of organisms within their range. This is a key issue in marine systems, where many organisms produce dispersive larvae that develop offshore before returning to settle on benthic habitat. We investigated the distribution of the neon goby, Elacatinus lori, on sponge habitat and evaluated whether variation in the persistence of recently settled individuals (i.e. settlers) among different sponge types can result in habitat preferences and establish their observed distribution. We found that E. lori settlers were more likely to occur on large yellow tube sponges (Aplysina fistularis) than on small yellow sponges or brown tube sponges (Agelas conifera). An experiment seeding settlers onto multiple species and sizes of sponge habitat revealed that settlers persist longer on large yellow sponges than on small yellow sponges or brown sponges. Habitat preference experiments also indicated that settlers prefer large yellow sponges over small yellow sponges or brown sponges. Settlers achieved these preference behaviors using visual, but not chemical, cues. Finally, new settlers arriving from the water column were more likely to occur on large yellow sponges than on small yellow sponges or brown sponges, indicating that the observed habitat preferences existed independent of prior experience. These results support the hypothesis that E. lori have evolved behavioral preferences for sponge habitats that will maximize their post-settlement persistence, and that decisions at settlement will shape the population level pattern of settler distribution on coral reefs.},

It has been suggested a means of communication in several taxa including flowers, pitcher plants, corals, algae, worms, squid, spiders, stomatopods, fish, reptiles, parrots and humans. The surface or object that the pigment molecule is part of appears to glow due to its setting rather than an actual production of light, and this may enhance both signals and, in some cases, camouflage. This review examines some known uses of fluorescence, mainly in the context of visual communication in animals, the challenge being to distinguish when fluorescence is a functional feature of biological coloration or when it is a by-product of a pigment or other molecule. In general, we conclude that most observations of fluorescence lack enough evidence to suggest they are used in visually driven behaviours.

  abstract = {Gregarious settlement, an essential behavior for many barnacle species that can only reproduce by mating with a nearby barnacle, has long been thought to rely on larval ability to recognize chemical signals from conspecifics during settlement. However, the cyprid, the settlement stage larva in barnacles, has one pair of compound eyes that appear only at the late nauplius VI and cyprid stages, but the function(s) of these eyes remains unknown. Here we show that cyprids of the intertidal barnacle Balanus (=Amphibalanus) amphitrite can locate adult barnacles even in the absence of chemical cues, and prefer to settle around them probably via larval sense of vision. We also show that the cyprids can discriminate color and preferred to settle on red surfaces. Moreover, we found that shells of adult B. amphitrite emit red auto-fluorescence and the adult extracts with the fluorescence as a visual signal attracted cyprid larvae to settle around it. We propose that the perception of specific visual signals can be involved in behavior of zooplankton including marine invertebrate larvae, and that barnacle auto-fluorescence may be a specific signal involved in gregarious larval settlement.},

The system collected fluorescence imagery in three spectral bands with 1 cm2 resolution at sites in Florida and the Bahamas. Fluorescence excitation was at 488 nm, and imagery was collected in emission bands centered at 520, 580, and 685 nm. Ground truth data on bottom cover was collected by divers using conventional line transect and photographic quadrat methods. A set of classification rules based on the relative signal levels in the three fluorescence channels was developed to assign the image pixels to functional groups. Once the image was classified, percent cover data for the groups were computed for the full image and for subsets of the image chosen to simulate line transect, grid survey, and photographic quadrat surveys. The statistics of percent cover of various bottom types derived from the fluorescence image compared favorably with those determined by diver survey techniques. The results demonstrate that fluorescence imaging has the long-term potential to provide coverage of large spatial areas of coral reefs at high resolution, with automated classification and quantification of functional groups in the image.},

In order to test whether the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) holds in less exposed shores comprised exclusively of smaller rocks (cobbles) we measured 1) the size frequency distribution of cobbles (mass and basal surface area), 2) the incidence of barnacle encrustation as an indirect measure of cobble disturbance, 3) the abundances of the dominant macroinvertebrates occurring beneath cobbles (the crab Hemigrapsus crenulatus, the chiton Sypharochiton pelliserpentis and the snail Diloma zealandica), and 4) macroinvertebrate fidelity beneath a range of cobble sizes. Only large cobbles were found to be encrusted with barnacles, indicative of their greater resistance to physical disturbance by waves and currents. Mark and relocate experiments indicated fidelity to a given cobble over two tidal cycles was 11--14\% for crabs and did not vary with cobble size. In contrast, fidelity to medium and large cobbles was higher for chitons (26--45\%) and snails (17--31\%) and generally increased with increasing cobble size. In contrast to the predictions of the IDH, there was a positive correlation between increasing cobble size and increasing species diversity of organisms found under the cobbles. This pattern is not simply attributable to greater space available beneath large cobbles as there was a significantly greater density of macroinvertebrates beneath medium and large, compared to the small cobbles. Increasing species diversity with increasing cobble size appears to be independent of patterns of species recolonization associated with small cobbles being subject to high disturbance or interspecific competitive hierarchies associated with low disturbance beneath large cobbles. Instead, factors such as aggregative behaviors, and reducing vulnerability to predators and desiccation stress are likely to explain the relationship between cobbles and their associated macroinvertebrate communities.},

  abstract = {Habitat structure may have important effects on the structure of natural communities. At least two aspects of habitat structure should be considered-the composition of the habitat (i.e. the material from which it is formed) and the number of different micro-habitats it contains. A number of assumptions has been made about how the latter aspect of habitat structure affects the number and abundances of species in natural assemblages. These assumptions have rarely been tested; nor, indeed, have there been many tests of the direct effects of habitat composition. The communities of organisms on intertidal boulders on two rock-platforms were studied. These platforms differed in the major type of rock present; boulders on one shore were predominantly sandstone, those on the other were mostly shale. The effects of this difference in composition of habitat were examined by exchanging bare boulders between the two shores. The green alga Ulva lactuca L. became much more abundant on sandstone boulders than on shale on both shores. This probably reflected the fact that sandstone retained more water during low tide and was a better substratum for growth of the alga. Spirorbid worms settled on the undersides of rocks but became more abundant on shale. This may have been because the shale rocks were more pitted and therefore provided greater protection from abrasion. Sampling showed that small natural boulders had less micro-habitat diversity than large boulders. Furthermore, the tops of these larger boulders were emersed for a significantly longer period during low tide. The effects of these factors were examined using solid concrete blocks as experimental boulders. The surfaces of the blocks were modified to create different densities and types of micro-habitats (i.e. great and small densities of pits and grooves). In addition, blocks of two different thicknesses were used to examine the effects of this characteristic of size of block. Both experimental factors affected the number of species and the abundances of some common species that grew on the blocks. The effects were complex and varied throughout the experiments. In general, however, the undersides of blocks with more micro-habitats supported more sessile animals. The tops of these blocks at high levels on the shore typically had more grazing gastropods. These effects were probably the result of species in pits and grooves being protected from disturbance and physical stress. In contrast, the number of species of algae was often greatest on blocks with the fewest micro-habitats, possibly because grazers were least abundant on these blocks. All of these findings were demonstrated to be a response to the experimental addition of the new micro-habitats themselves and not a function of increased surface-area. There were often more species of algae on the thinner concrete blocks, and this was probably a response to the shorter period of emersion of the thinner blocks during low tide. Overall, the experiments detected a variety of influences of several aspects of habitat structure. Some of these were pronounced, leading to major changes; others were less important. Notably, the effects of micro-habitat diversity were not always in the direction predicted by theory. These results indicate that further investigation is required of the effects of habitat structure on natural communities.},

These organisms are disturbed when boulders are moved by waves or buried in sand. Experiments were done to test the hypothesis that these disturbances are responsible for the reduced diversity and abundance of the assemblages on the undersides of small boulders. Boulders on one shore were bolted to the substratum to prevent movement by waves. In two separate experiments on another shore, boulders with and without attached organisms were buried in a few centimetres of sand. All experiments included relevant controls and were done high and low on the shore using rocks of several sizes. The assemblages of algae developing on the tops of all stabilised boulders, regardless of size, were similar to those on boulders free to roll indicating that, in contrast to results elsewhere, disturbance by waves was too infrequent or slight to affect these species. The tops of rocks were also rarely buried in sand and the main influences on the community in this situation were apparently exposure at low-tide and grazing gastropods. More species, however, did settle or survive on the undersides of rocks which were free of sand or could not be moved by waves; thus disturbances were important in this situation. In the absence of disturbance low on the shore, much or all space was occupied and sessile species such as sponges and ascidians overgrew other forms and reduced diversity. This did not happen higher on the shore and here diversity was simply an increasing function of rock-size. Overall disturbance played a similar role in all places -- it killed organisms and created free space -- but the final effects on the community varied depending upon the species present and the actions of other factors.},

  abstract = {Eye evolution is driven by the evolution of visually guided behavior. Accumulation of gradually more demanding behaviors have continuously increased the performance requirements on the photoreceptor organs. Starting with nondirectional photoreception, I argue for an evolutionary sequence continuing with directional photoreception, low-resolution vision, and finally, high-resolution vision. Calculations of the physical requirements for these four sensory tasks show that they correlate with major innovations in eye evolution and thus work as a relevant classification for a functional analysis of eye evolution. Together with existing molecular and morphological data, the functional analysis suggests that urbilateria had a simple set of rhabdomeric and ciliary receptors used for directional photoreception, and that organ duplications, positional shifts and functional shifts account for the diverse patterns of eyes and photoreceptors seen in extant animals. The analysis also suggests that directional photoreception evolved independently at least twice before the last common ancestor of bilateria and proceeded several times independently to true vision in different bilaterian and cnidarian groups. This scenario is compatible with Pax-gene expression in eye development in the different animal groups. The whole process from the first opsin to high-resolution vision took about 170 million years and was largely completed by the onset of the Cambrian, about 530 million years ago. Evolution from shadow detectors to multiple directional photoreceptors has further led to secondary cases of eye evolution in bivalves, fan worms, and chitons.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Biofluorescence has been detected in several nocturnal-crepuscular organisms from invertebrates to birds and mammals. Biofluorescence in mammals has been detected across the phylogeny, including the monotreme duck-billed platypus (               Ornithorhyncus anatinus               ), marsupial opossums (Didelphidae), and New World placental flying squirrels (               Gluacomys               spp.). Here, we document vivid biofluorescence of springhare (Pedetidae) in both museum specimens and captive individuals---the first documented biofluorescence of an Old World placental mammal. We explore the variation in biofluorescence across our sample and characterize its physical and chemical properties. The striking visual patterning and intensity of color shift was unique relative to biofluorescence found in other mammals. We establish that biofluorescence in springhare likely originates within the cuticle of the hair fiber and emanates, at least partially, from several fluorescent porphyrins and potentially one unassigned molecule absent from our standard porphyrin mixture. This discovery further supports the hypothesis that biofluorescence may be ecologically important for nocturnal-crepuscular mammals and suggests that it may be more broadly distributed throughout Mammalia than previously thought.},

Here, aggregation of chiton species (Polyplacophora; Neoloricata; Ischnochitonina; Ischnochitonidae; Ischnochitoninae; Ischnochiton) living under boulders in intertidal boulder fields was investigated at several relatively small spatial scales. Closely related species were found to be aggregated at the level of individual boulders, but evidence for grouping at the larger scale of patches of boulders varied.When organisms are mobile, dispersal can have an important influence on spatial patterns. Some organisms, such as marine invertebrates, have a highly dispersive larval phase that can influence spatial patterns of adults, particularly where the adult is sessile or relatively sedentary. Aggregation was compared in two species to test whether different modes of larval development influence spatial pattern.There was some evidence that species with a planktonic larva were even more aggregated than expected, in contrast to predictions based on this mode of development. Both types of larval development (planktonic and non-planktonic) produce larvae with short development times in these species, so one possible explanation for the grouping habit of these chitons is that they do not disperse, at all, from their natal boulder. The complexity of the boulder field habitat and the cryptic behaviour of these chitons may also contribute to a lack of dispersal. A simple application of a genetic method indicated, however, that philopatry at this scale is unlikely.},

  abstract = {Habitat selection can determine the distribution and performance of individuals if the precision with which sites are chosen corresponds with exposure to risks or resources. Contrastingly, facilitation can allow persistence of individuals arriving by chance and potentially maladapted to local abiotic conditions. For marine organisms, selection of a permanent attachment site at the end of their larval stage or the presence of a facilitator can be a critical determinant of recruitment success. In coral reef ecosystems, it is well known that settling planula larvae of reef-building corals use coarse environmental cues (i.e., light) for habitat selection. Although laboratory studies suggest that larvae can also use precise biotic cues produced by crustose coralline algae (CCA) to select attachment sites, the ecological consequences of biotic cues for corals are poorly understood in situ. In a field experiment exploring the relative importance of biotic cues and variability in habitat quality to recruitment of hard corals, pocilloporid and acroporid corals recruited more frequently to one species of CCA, Titanoderma prototypum, and significantly less so to other species of CCA; these results are consistent with laboratory assays from other studies. The provision of the biotic cue accurately predicted coral recruitment rates across habitats of varying quality. At the scale of CCA, corals attached to the ``preferred'' CCA experienced increased survivorship while recruits attached elsewhere had lower colony growth and survivorship. For reef-building corals, the behavioral selection of habitat using chemical cues both reduces the risk of incidental mortality and indicates the presence of a facilitator.},

Here, we report on the discovery of iridophore-based, neon-green flourescence in the gecko Pachydactylus rangei, localised to the skin around the eyes and along the flanks. The maximum emission of the fluorescence is at a wavelength of 516~nm in the green spectrum (excitation maximum 465~nm, blue) with another, smaller peak at 430~nm. The fluorescent regions of the skin show large numbers of iridophores, which are lacking in the non-fluorescent parts. Two types of iridophores are recognized, fluorescent iridophores and basal, non-fluorescent iridophores, the latter of which might function as a mirror, amplifying the omnidirectional fluorescence. The strong intensity of the fluorescence (quantum yield of 12.5\%) indicates this to be a highly effective mechanism, unique among tetrapods. Although the fluorescence is associated with iridophores, the spectra of emission and excitation as well as the small Stokes shifts argue against guanine crystals as its source, but rather a rigid pair of fluorophores. Further studies are necessary to identify their morphology and chemical structures. We hypothesise that this nocturnal gecko uses the neon-green fluorescence, excited by moonlight, for intraspecific signalling in its open desert habitat.},

High-resolution image-forming eyes evolved from low-resolution eyes via increases in photoreceptor cell number, improvements in optics and changes in the neural circuits that process spatially resolved photoreceptor input. However, the evolutionary origins of the first low-resolution visual systems have been unclear. We propose that the lowest resolving (two-pixel) visual systems could initially have functioned in visual phototaxis. During visual phototaxis, such elementary visual systems compare light on either side of the body to regulate phototactic turns. Another, even simpler and non-visual strategy is characteristic of helical phototaxis, mediated by sensory--motor eyespots. The recent mapping of the complete neural circuitry (connectome) of an elementary visual system in the larva of the annelid Platynereis dumerilii sheds new light on the possible paths from non-visual to visual phototaxis and to image-forming vision. We outline an evolutionary scenario focusing on the neuronal circuitry to account for these transitions. We also present a comprehensive review of the structure of phototactic eyes in invertebrate larvae and assign them to the non-visual and visual categories. We propose that non-visual systems may have preceded visual phototactic systems in evolution that in turn may have repeatedly served as intermediates during the evolution of image-forming eyes.},

Energy provided by the Sun has the potential to access different chemistries than energy provided by other sources, such as hydrothermal vents, because of the unique characteristics of photochemistry that differentiate it from conventional thermal chemistry. This review considers how sunlight-driven reactions can abiotically generate prebiotic molecules necessary for the evolution of life. We discuss briefly the characteristics of the early Sun and the likely environmental conditions on the early Earth because photochemistry is both environment- and molecule-specific. An overview of the fundamental principles of photophysics and photochemistry is followed by discussion of a selection of prebiotically-relevant examples of photochemical reactions, focusing on syntheses that lead to the production of cellular components (               e.g.               sugars, lipids, and biopolymer precursors). The role of photostability as an evolutionary driving force is also considered.

During shell selection, various shell characteristics are investigated by the crab to determine their suitability. Here we consider the role of visual cues. Previous research suggests that some hermit crabs are more likely to initially choose a conspicuous shell but also to move to backgrounds against which they are less conspicuous, suggesting a short-term/longterm trade-off. Across experiments in which we manipulated shell and background colour, we show initially that Pagurus bernhardus prefer black shells over white but this preference was lost in the absence of visual cues. We then show that the strength of preference was dependent on background colour. We repeated this last experiment with red and yellow shells against red or yellow backgrounds to investigate whether this preference extended to chromatic hues. A preference for darker (red) shells was expressed, but preference alteration with background was not observed. P. bernhardus therefore discriminate between shells in terms of shell and back\- ground colour, and discrimination may be rooted in a preference for darker shaded shells.},

Twenty to forty percent of larvae of A. palmata settled on coralline surfaces of Hydrolithon boergesenii, Lithoporella atlantica, Neogoniolithon affine, and Titanoderma prototypum, whereas none settled and metamorphosed on Neogoniolithon mamillare. Larvae of M. faveolata had 13--25~\% settlement onto the surface of Amphiroa tribulus, H. boergesenii, N. affine, N. munitum, and T. prototypum, but had no settlement on the surface of N. mamillare, Porolithon pachydermum, and a noncoralline crust Peyssonnelia sp. Some of these algal species were common on Belizean reefs, but the species that induced the highest rates of larval settlement and metamorphosis tended to be rare and primarily found in low-light environments. The shallow coral, A. palmata, and the deeper coral, M. faveolata, both had increased larval settlement rates in the presence of only a few species of red algae found at deeper depths suggesting that patterns of coral distribution can only sometimes be related to the distribution of red algae species.},

The CCA Phymatolithon repandum induced close to 100\% metamorphosis of Haliotis iris larvae. Pebbles and shells with a biofilm but without visible macroalgae induced, on average, 58\% metamorphosis on H. iris larvae within 2 days, and biofilms are commonly used to cue settlement in H. iris hatcheries. This suggests that settlement on P. repandum might be triggered by the surface biofilm rather than the CCA itself. Treatment of P. repandum with antibiotics, germanium dioxide, and scrubbing did not significantly reduce settlement of H. iris larvae. Diatom strains isolated from P. repandum induced little attachment or metamorphosis at the low diatom densities (103--104 cells/cm2) found on P. repandum, but induced moderate attachment (30--85\% after 4 days) and metamorphosis (2--40\%) at high densities (5 {\texttimes} 104-1 {\texttimes} 106 cells/cm2). Nine bacterial strains isolated from P. repandum induced low-percent attachment (0--45\% after 7 days) and metamorphosis (0--20\%) if assayed in the presence of antibiotics. Parallel assays without antibiotics had higher attachment (40--80\% after 7 days) and metamorphosis (5--50\%), but this activity may have arisen from bacteria introduced with the larvae. Although bacteria and diatoms did induce some attachment and metamorphosis of H. iris larvae, they were less effective than P. repandum (95\% within 2 days). Treatments that greatly reduced the biofilm on P. repandum had no effect on its settlement-inducing activity. This evidence supports the view of CCA as an especially potent source of inducers for temperate abalone larval settlement.},

  abstract = {Bioluminescence, the mesmerizing natural phenomenon where living organisms produce light through chemical reactions, has long captivated scientists and laypersons alike, offering a rich tapestry of insights into biological function, ecology, evolution as well as the underlying chemistry. This comprehensive introductory review systematically explores the phenomenon of bioluminescence, addressing its historical context, geographic dispersion, and ecological significance with a focus on their chemical mechanisms. Our examination begins with terrestrial bioluminescence, discussing organisms from different habitats. We analyze thefireflies of Central Europe's meadows and the fungi in the Atlantic rainforest of Brazil. Additionally, we inspect bioluminescent species in New Zealand, specifically river--dwelling snails and mosquito larvae found in Waitomo Caves. Our exploration concludes in the Siberian Steppes, highlighting the area`s luminescent insects and annelids. Transitioning to the marine realm, the second part of this review examines marine bioluminescent organisms. We explore this phenomenon in deep--sea jellyfish and their role in the ecosystem. We then move to Toyama Bay, Japan, where seasonal bioluminescence of dinoflagellates and ostracods present a unique case study. We also delve into the bacterial world, discussing how bioluminescent bacteria contribute to symbiotic relationships. For each organism, we contextualize its bioluminescence, providing details about its discovery, ecological function, and geographical distribution. A special focus lies on the examination of the underlying chemical mechanisms that enables these biological light displays. Concluding this review, we present a series of practical bioluminescence and chemiluminescence experiments, providing a resource for educational demonstrations and student research projects. Our goal with this review is to provide a summary of bioluminescence across the diverse ecological contexts, contributing to the broader understanding of this unique biological phenomenon and its chemical mechanisms serving researchers new to the field, educators and students alike.},

These patterns were reflected in the microhabitat abundances of `old' and `young' barnacles. Comparisons were made of the survivorship and the frequency of shell damage in two populations of the limpet Lottia gigantea living in habitats which differed primarily in the number of moveable rocks (i.e. potential projectiles). The mortality rate and frequency of shell damage were significantly higher in the projectilerich habitat. In addition only in this habitat did the frequency of shell damage covary significantly with seasonal periods of high surf. Investigation of the response of limpet shells to impacts suggests that shell strength varies between species and increases with shell size. Species-specific patterns of non-fatal shell breakage may have evolved to absorb the energy of impacts. In two of the intertidal habitats studied, wave-borne rock damage was chronic and, at least in part, may have governed the faunal makeup of the community by contributing to the physical `boundaries'' of the environment within which the inhabitants must survive.},

  abstract = {Species recognition can be interpreted as the identification of sexual compatibility among individuals, which is related to the assessment of partner quality. This compatibility can be assessed using visual signals of conspecifics such as body coloration. Fiddler crabs constitute a group with a global distribution, comprising over 100 species with diverse colours. They perceive these body colours and use them for intersexual communication, primarily through signalling of the hypertrophied claw of males. However, few species have been investigated regarding the role of body coloration as a species-specific signal, and it remains unknown whether other body regions, such as the carapace, convey information about individual quality or species identity. Hence, this study aimed to examine whether carapace coloration of two sympatric fiddler crab species (Leptuca leptodactyla and Leptuca cumulanta) affects species recognition. To do this, we used individual females of L.~leptodactyla that were subjected to a binomial choice of males with claws and carapaces reflecting different colours, simulating conspecifics (L.~leptodactyla) or heterospecifics (L.~cumulanta). We observed that females were unable to distinguish conspecifics from heterospecifics using only claw colour. On the other hand, we discovered that the white carapace coloration of L.~leptodactyla was crucial for females to identify conspecific males. This is the first study to demonstrate that carapace coloration of male fiddler crabs functions in species recognition, reinforcing the idea that body traits beyond sexual ornaments can influence animal communication, affecting species identity and/or mate selection.},

  abstract = {In optimal foraging theory, search time is a key variable defining the value of a prey type. But the sensory-perceptual processes that constrain the search for food have rarely been considered. Here we evaluate the flight behavior of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) searching for artificial flowers of various sizes and colors. When flowers were large, search times correlated well with the color contrast of the targets with their green foliage-type background, as predicted by a model of color opponent coding using inputs from the bees' UV, blue, and green receptors. Targets that made poor color contrast with their backdrop, such as white, UV-reflecting ones, or red flowers, took longest to detect, even though brightness contrast with the background was pronounced. When searching for small targets, bees changed their strategy in several ways. They flew significantly slower and closer to the ground, so increasing the minimum detectable area subtended by an object on the ground. In addition, they used a different neuronal channel for flower detection. Instead of color contrast, they used only the green receptor signal for detection. We relate these findings to temporal and spatial limitations of different neuronal channels involved in stimulus detection and recognition. Thus, foraging speed may not be limited only by factors such as prey density, flight energetics, and scramble competition. Our results show that understanding the behavioral ecology of foraging can substantially gain from knowledge about mechanisms of visual information processing.},

Whereas the majority of fluorescent proteins have been identified from cnidarians, recently several fluorescent proteins have been isolated across the animal tree of life. Here we show that biofluorescence is not only phylogenetically widespread, but is also phenotypically variable across both cartilaginous and bony fishes, highlighting its evolutionary history and the possibility for discovery of numerous novel fluorescent proteins. Fish biofluorescence is especially common and morphologically variable in cryptically patterned coralreef lineages. We identified 16 orders, 50 families, 105 genera, and more than 180 species of biofluorescent fishes. We have also reconstructed our current understanding of the phylogenetic distribution of biofluorescence for ray-finned fishes. The presence of yellow long-pass intraocular filters in many biofluorescent fish lineages and the substantive color vision capabilities of coral-reef fishes suggest that they are capable of detecting fluoresced light. We present species-specific emission patterns among closely related species, indicating that biofluorescence potentially functions in intraspecific communication and evidence that fluorescence can be used for camouflage. This research provides insight into the distribution, evolution, and phenotypic variability of biofluorescence in marine lineages and examines the role this variation may play.},

These ocelli each contain a pigment layer, retina, and lens [2], but it is unknown whether they provide chitons with spatial vision [3]. It is also unclear whether chiton lenses are made from proteins, like nearly all biological lenses, or from some other material [4]. Electron probe X-ray microanalysis and X-ray diffraction revealed that the chiton Acanthopleura granulata has the first aragonite lenses ever discovered. We found that these lenses allow A. granulata's ocelli to function as small camera eyes with an angular resolution of about 9 --12 . Animals responded to the sudden appearance of black, overhead circles with an angular size of 9 , but not to equivalent, uniform decreases in the downwelling irradiance. Our behavioral estimates of angular resolution were consistent with estimates derived from focal length and receptor spacing within the A. granulata eye. Behavioral trials further indicated that A. granulata's eyes provide the same angular resolution in both air and water. We propose that one of the two refractive indices of the birefringent chiton lens places a focused image on the retina in air, whereas the other does so in water.},

  abstract = {The population density of the limpet Acmaea testudinalis is highest on the crustose coralline alga Clathromorphum circumscriptum in both tide pool and subtidal environments in the Gulf of Maine. Juvenile limpets recruit to C. circumscriptum and both juveniles and adults preferentially feed on this species (not its epibionts) over a choice of other corallines, foliose algae, microalgae (diatoms), and detritus. Abundances of the predator (limpet) and the prey (coralline) are positively correlated, and the fitness of both organisms may be increased by the association. Acmaea testudinalis possesses a radula apparently adapted to eat efficiently C. circumscriptum, a food of low caloric value. The coralline is not only an abundant and dependable food throughout the geographic range of the limpet but also provides a superior holding surface for it. Clathromorphum circumscriptum requires grazing to remove potentially lethal epiphytes, but is not harmed by limpet grazing since it possesses a uniquely thick protective tissue over the region of growth. Reproductive structures of C. circumscriptum develop in winter and are buried below the surface so the effects of grazing on them are minimal. Over a wide range of depths, the rate of cell removal by limpets matches the rate of cell production by Clathromorphum. The number of apparently specific adaptations of both organisms, with mutual advantages, suggests evolution toward a coevolved interdependency. Trophic specialization of small organisms with low mobility (limpets) on larger, longer lived prey (coralline algae and kelps) is more likely than in other herbivore/prey interactions. By specializing on a long---lived and predictable food source, A. testudinalis may have evolved a strategy of economy by minimizing its cost of foraging (risk to predation and energy expenditure) relative to its absolute intake of calories. This foraging strategy may have been reinforced over time since it also improves the survivorship of the preferred prey.},

  abstract = {Throughout their lives animals must complete many tasks, including finding food, avoiding predators, attracting mates, and navigating through a complex and dynamic environment. Consequently, they have evolved a staggering array of sensory organs that are fundamental to survival and reproduction and shape much of their evolution and behaviour. Sensory ecology deals with how animals acquire, process, and use information in their lives, and the sensory systems involved. It investigates the type of information that is gathered by animals, how it is used in a range of behaviours, and the evolution of such traits. It deals with both mechanistic questions (e.g. how sensory receptors capture information from the environment, and how the physical attributes of the environment affect information transmission) and functional questions (e.g. the adaptive significance of the information used by the animal to make a decision). Recent research has dealt more explicitly with how sensory systems are involved with and even drive evolutionary change, including the formation of new species. Sensory Ecology, Behaviour, and Evolution provides a broad introduction to sensory ecology across a wide range of taxonomic groups, covering all the various sensory modalities (e.g. sound, visual, chemical, magnetic, and electric) relating to diverse areas spanning anti-predator strategies, foraging, mate choice, navigation and more, with the aim being to illustrate key principles and differences. This accessible textbook is suitable for senior undergraduates, graduate students, and professional academics taking courses or conducting research in sensory ecology/biology, neuroethology, behavioural and evolutionary ecology, communication, and signalling. It will also be of relevance and use to psychologists interested in sensory information and behaviour.},

  abstract = {Porphyrias are disorders of heme metabolism frequently characterized by extreme photosensitivity. This symptom results from accumulation of porphyrins, tetrapyrrole intermediates in heme biosynthesis that generate reactive oxygen species when exposed to light, in the skin of affected individuals. Here we report that in addition to producing an ommochrome body pigment, the planarian flatworm Schmidtea mediterranea generates porphyrins in its subepithelial pigment cells under physiological conditions, and that this leads to pigment cell loss when animals are exposed to intense visible light. Remarkably, porphyrin biosynthesis and light-induced depigmentation are enhanced by starvation, recapitulating a common feature of some porphyrias -- decreased nutrient intake precipitates an acute manifestation of the disease. Our results establish planarians as an experimentally tractable animal model for research into the pathophysiology of acute porphyrias, and potentially for the identification of novel pharmacological interventions capable of alleviating porphyrin-mediated photosensitivity or decoupling dieting and fasting from disease pathogenesis.           ,              Porphyrias are rare diseases that involve ring-shaped molecules called porphyrins accumulating in various parts of the body. Porphyrins are produced as part of the normal process that makes an important molecule called heme, which is required to transport oxygen. However, high levels of porphyrins can be toxic. For example, porphyrins deposited in the skin can cause swelling and blistering when the skin is exposed to bright light. Other disease symptoms include neurological issues ranging from anxiety and confusion to seizures or paralysis. It has been speculated that porphyrias may have affected several historical figures, including the artist Vincent van Gogh.             In addition to their role in heme production, porphyrins also have other roles. For example, they are used as pigments in the wing feathers of some owls. Researchers are trying to understand more about how organisms regulate porphyrin production so that it might be possible to develop more effective treatments for porphyria in humans.             Here, Stubenhaus et al. studied how a flatworm called Schmidtea mediterranea makes porphyrins. A group of undergraduate students noticed that these animals -- which are normally brown in color -- turned white when they were exposed to sunlight for several days. Stubenhaus et al. found that S. mediterranea makes porphyrins in the pigment cells of its skin using the same genes that make porphyrins in humans. Together with other molecules called ommochromes, the porphyrins give rise to the normal color of this flatworm. However, when the animals are exposed to intense light for extended periods of time, which is unlikely to occur in the wild, porphyrin production leads to loss of the pigment cells.             The experiments also show that starvation increases the rate of pigment cell loss in light-exposed flatworms, which mirrors the worsening of disease symptoms some porphyria patients experience when they diet or fast. Stubenhaus et al. propose that flatworms are useful models in which to study the molecular processes that are responsible for porphyrias in humans. Further research is required to determine the exact chemical structure of the porphyrin and ommochrome molecules produced in different flatworm species. Stubenhaus et al. also plan to use flatworms to screen for drugs that could potentially be developed into new treatments for porphyria.},

In macroscopic animals such as birds, fluorescence provides a visual communication signal. However, the functional significance of this phenomenon is unknown in most cases. Though photoprotection is attributed to fluorescence under ultraviolet (UV) light in some organisms, it lacks direct experimental evidence. Here, we demonstrate naturally occurring fluorescence under UV light in a eutardigrade belonging to the genus Paramacrobiotus. Using a natural variant that lacks fluorescence, we show that the fluorescence confers tolerance to lethal UV radiation. Remarkably, the fluorescent extract from Paramacrobiotus sp. could protect the UV-sensitive tardigrade Hypsibius exemplaris and nematode Caenorhabditis elegans from germicidal UV radiation. We propose that Paramacrobiotus sp. possess a protective fluorescent shield that absorbs harmful UV radiation and emits harmless blue light.},

  abstract = {Almost all animals can sense light, but only those with spatial vision can ``see.'' Conventionally, this was restricted to animals possessing discrete visual organs (eyes), but extraocular vision could facilitate vision without eyes. Echinoderms form the focus of extraocular vision research [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], and the brittle star Ophiocoma wendtii, which exhibits light-responsive color change and shelter seeking, became a key species of interest [4, 8, 9]. Both O.~wendtii and an apparently light-indifferent congeneric, O.~pumila, possess an extensive network of r-opsin-reactive cells, but its function remains unclear [4]. We show that, although both species are strongly light averse, O.~wendtii orients to stimuli necessitating spatial vision for detection, but O.~pumila does not. However, O.~wendtii's response disappears when chromatophores are contracted within the skeleton. Combining immunohistochemistry, histology, and synchrotron microtomography, we reconstructed models of photoreceptors in situ and extracted estimated angular apertures for O.~wendtii and O.~pumila. Angular sensitivity estimates, derived from these models, support the hypothesis that chromatophores constitute a screening mechanism in O.~wendtii, providing sufficient resolving power to detect the stimuli. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) identified opsin candidates in both species, including multiple r-opsins and transduction pathway constituents, congruent with immunohistochemistry and studies of other echinoderms [10, 11]. Finally, we note that differing body postures between the two species during experiments may reflect aspect of signal integration. This represents one of the most detailed mechanisms for extraocular vision yet proposed and draws interesting parallels with the only other confirmed extraocular visual system, that of some sea urchins, which also possess chromatophores [1].},

In the planula, external stimuli are percieved at the cellular level and no sensory organs can be found while in the simple ascidian tadpole, external stimuli are perceived by well-defined sensory organs. A comparative experimental laboratory study was carried out to investigate effects of light intensity on phototactic and geotactic behaviour at settlement of the planulae of the scyphozoan Cyanea capillata L. and the tadpole of the solitary ascidian Ascidia mentula O.F. M{\"u}ller. In the field, scyphistomae of Cyanea and juveniles of Ascidia are mostly found in shaded habitats and downward facing substrata most likely as a result of larval behaviour. Field measurements of light conditions were made in habitats where the two species commonly occur. The planula and the tadpole responded significantly to light as low as 2 {\texttimes} 1017 Quanta{$\cdot$}s-1{$\cdot$} m-2 equalent to 10 Lux and 6 {\texttimes} 1014 Quanta{$\cdot$}s-1{$\cdot$} m-2 equalent to 0.1 Lux, respectively. In both larval types, no effect of light intensity on negative geotaxis was evident. Ecological aspects of the larval behavioural patterns are discussed.},

We report fluorescence in amphibians, in the tree frog               Hypsiboas punctatus,               showing that fluorescence in living frogs is produced by a combination of lymph and glandular emission, with pigmentary cell filtering in the skin. The chemical origin of fluorescence was traced to a class of fluorescent compounds derived from dihydroisoquinolinone, here named hyloins. We show that fluorescence contributes 18-29\% of the total emerging light under twilight and nocturnal scenarios, largely enhancing brightness of the individuals and matching the sensitivity of night vision in amphibians. These results introduce an unprecedented source of pigmentation in amphibians and highlight the potential relevance of fluorescence in visual perception in terrestrial environments.},

  abstract = {Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorbs a substantial fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in boreal lakes. However, few studies have systematically estimated how this light absorption influences pelagic primary productivity. In this study, 75 boreal lakes spanning wide and orthogonal gradients in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total phosphorus (TP) were sampled during a synoptic survey. We measured absorption spectra of phytoplankton pigments, CDOM, and non-algal particles to quantify the vertical fate of photons in the PAR region. Area-specific rates of gross primary productivity (PPA) were estimated using a bio-optical approach based on phytoplankton in vivo light absorption and the light-dependent quantum yield of photochemistry in PSII measured by a PAM fluorometer. Subsequently, we calculated the effects of CDOM, DOC, and TP concentration on PPA. CDOM absorbed the largest fraction of PAR in the majority of lakes (mean 56.3\%, range 36.9--76.2\%), phytoplankton pigments captured a comparatively minor fraction (mean 6.6\%, range 2.2--28.2\%). PPA estimates spanned from 45 to 993~mg~C~m-2~day-1 (median 286~mg~C~m-2~day-1). We found contrasting effects of CDOM (negative) and TP (positive) on PPA. The use of DOC or CDOM as predictors gave very similar results and the negative effect of these variables on PPA can probably be attributed to shading. A future scenario of increased DOC, which is highly correlated with CDOM in these lakes, might impose negative effects on areal primary productivity in boreal lakes.},

We assessed the ability of the hermit crab Pagurus minutus to process different types of cues during predator avoidance and to discriminate between predators and non-predators by measuring the length of time that the hermit crabs remained retracted within their shells (hiding time) after exposure to visual cues, chemical cues, or both. Video images were used as visual cues, and water from aquaria holding predators or non-predators were used as chemical cues. The predator species was the portunid crab Charybdis japonica, and the non-predator species was the hermit crab Clibanarius infraspinatus. Natural seawater and background video were used as controls. Test individuals were exposed to each cue for 100~s. Both visual and chemical predator cues significantly increased hiding time in comparison to the controls, whereas non-predator cues did not significantly affect hiding time, indicating that P. minutus can discriminate between predators and non-predators from both visual and chemical cues. However, exposure to visual and chemical cues simultaneously did not significantly lengthen hiding times in comparison to exposure to a single cue type, indicating that there is no dominance in risk hierarchy between visual and chemical cues, and that P. minutus integrates information from both types of cues as if they were a single cue. We discuss the differences in our results from those previously obtained with a similar experimental design for the hermit crab P. granosimanus.},
