  abstract = {Despite the great interest in characterizing the functional structure and resilience of functional groups in natural communities, few studies have examined in which way the roles and relationships of coexisting species change during community succession, a fundamental and natural process that follows the release of new resources in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Variation in algal traits that characterize different phases and stages of community succession on rocky shores are likely to influence the magnitude, direction of effects, and the level of redundancy and complementarity in the diverse assemblage of herbivores. Two separate field experiments were conducted to quantify per capita and population effects and the functional relationship (i.e., redundancy or complementarity) of four herbivore species found in central Chile during early and late algal succession. The first experiment examined grazer effects on the colonization and establishment of early-succession algal species. The second experiment examined effects on the late-successional, dominant corticated alga Mazzaella laminarioides. Complementary laboratory experiments with all species and under natural environmental conditions allowed us to further characterize the collective effects of these species. We found that, during early community succession, all herbivore species had similar effects on the ephemeral algae, ulvoids, but only during the phase of colonization. Once these algae were established, only a subset of the species was able to control their abundance. During late succession, only the keyhole limpet Fissurella crassa could control corticated Mazzaella. The functional relationships among these species changed dramatically from redundant effects on ephemeral algae during early colonization, to a more complementary role on established early-successional algae, to a dominant (i.e., keystone) effect on late succession. This study highlights that functional relationship within consumer assemblages can vary at different phases and times of community succession. Differentiation in herbivore roles emphasizes the need to evaluate consumer's impacts through different times of community succession, and through experimental manipulations to make even broad predictions about the resilience or vulnerability of diverse intertidal assemblages to human disturbances.},

Symbiosis is established in most corals through the uptake of               Symbiodinium               from the environment. Corals are sessile for most of their life history, whereas free-living               Symbiodinium               are motile; hence, a mechanism to attract               Symbiodinium               would greatly increase the probability of encounter between host and symbiont. Here, we examined whether corals can attract free-living motile               Symbiodinium               by their green fluorescence, emitted by the excitation of endogenous GFP by purple-blue light. We found that               Symbiodinium               have positive and negative phototaxis toward weak green and strong purple-blue light, respectively. Under light conditions that cause corals to emit green fluorescence, (e.g., strong blue light),               Symbiodinium               were attracted toward live coral fragments.               Symbiodinium               were also attracted toward an artificial green fluorescence dye with similar excitation and emission spectra to coral-GFP. In the field, more               Symbiodinium               were found in traps painted with a green fluorescence dye than in controls. Our results revealed a biological signaling mechanism between the coral host and its potential symbionts.},

  abstract = {The broad perspective regarding marine-organisms biodiversity indicates a latitudinal gradient. Understanding gradients in diversity at large scales has important applications for understanding future impacts on local and regional communities. We use and propose the edible mollusk Chiton articulatus as the basibiont proxy to analyze the spatio-temporal changes in biodiversity patterns of the epibiotic community occupying its scleritome surface. The analyses covered approximately 1817~km of the Mexican Pacific, using seven sites that included samples from Sinaloa ``SIN'' (23{$^\circ$}38{$\prime$}N, 106{$^\circ$}48{$\prime$}W); Nayarit ``NAY'' (20{$^\circ$}45{$\prime$}N, 105{$^\circ$}22{$\prime$}W); Jalisco ``JAL'' (19{$^\circ$}13{$\prime$}N, 104{$^\circ$}41{$\prime$}W); Colima ``COL'' (19{$^\circ$}06{$\prime$}N, 104{$^\circ$}20{$\prime$}W); Michoacan ``MIC'' (17{$^\circ$}54{$\prime$}N, 102{$^\circ$}11'"W); Guerrero ``GRO'' (16{$^\circ$}48{$\prime$}N, 99{$^\circ$}52{$\prime$}W) and Oaxaca ``OAX'' (15{$^\circ$}39{$\prime$}N, 96{$^\circ$}30{$\prime$}W). A temporal gradient (monthly sampling from October 2015 to October 2016) was also analyzed. Evaluation of the sampling effort demonstrated that 76--86\% of the epibiotic fauna was recovered. The most representative epibionts were barnacles, a limpet and an acrothoracican. Abundances of the barnacles and the limpet tended to decrease southwards, while the acrothoracican tended to increase northwards. The epibiotic community did not exhibit the typical latitudinal gradient of diversity expected, but a fragmented pattern within three main areas, which coincide with three of the marine biogeographic ecoregions proposed for the shallow waters of the Warm Temperate Northern Pacific and Tropical Eastern Pacific provinces. These were a northern group within SIN, which belong to the southern border of the Magdalena Transition ecoregion (subtropical); a middle group within NAY, JAL, COL, MIC, and GRO, which belongs to the Mexican Tropical Pacific ecoregion (tropical); and a southern group within OAX exclusively, belonging to the northern border of the Chiapas-Nicaragua ecoregion (tropical). The southern localities showed larger dominances and the central localities exhibited more stable communities. Our evidence suggests that as we move across the different shore types of the Mexican Pacific, the coastline supports distinct biotic assemblages, and the community on the rocky shores is biologically heterogeneous and mainly influenced by conditions at the local level. In consequence, conservation and protection efforts should consider preserving the local heterogeneity of habitats in the study area. Furthermore, since C. articulatus is edible, its epibiota represents an incidental fishing bycatch, with the result that the extraction of the chiton and its epibiota can jeopardy the diversity in the intertidal rocky shore of the Mexican Pacific.},

  abstract = {The environment contains different forms of ecological noise that can reduce the ability of animals to detect information. Here, we ask whether animals adapt their behavior to either exploit or avoid areas of their environment with increased dynamic visual noise. Three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were immersed in environments with a simulated form of naturally occurring visual noise---moving light bands that form on underwater substrates caused by the refraction of light through surface waves. We tested whether this form of visual noise affected fish's habitat selection, movements, and prey-targeting behavior. Fish avoided areas of the environment with increased visual noise and achieved this by increasing their activity as a function of the locally perceived noise level. Fish were less likely to respond to virtual prey in environments with increased visual noise, highlighting a potential impact that visual noise has on their perceptual abilities. Fish did not increase or decrease their refuge use in environments with increased visual noise, providing no evidence that visual noise increased either exploratory or risk-aversive behavior. Our results indicate that animals can use simple behavioral strategies to avoid visually noisy environments, thereby mitigating the impacts that these environments appear to have on their perceptual abilities.},

An encrusting coralline alga is the major food item of this chiton. Experiments were performed to test the settling response of T. lineata larvae to various algae and other substrata. In these experiments, the larvae would settle only on pieces of encrusting coralline algae and pieces of ceramic roofing tile soaked in a coralline algal extract. The settling stimulus is probably chemical in nature, and is inactivated by boiling. In laboratory cultures, normal development stops at the trochophore stage (110 to 160 h, depending on the temperature). Metamorphosis and further development will take place only after settlement on encrusting coralline algae.},

  abstract = {The light environment in water bodies changes with depth due to the absorption of short and long wavelengths. Below 10\,m depth, red wavelengths are almost completely absent rendering any red-reflecting animal dark and achromatic. However, fluorescence may produce red coloration even when red light is not available for reflection. A large number of marine taxa including over 270 fish species are known to produce red fluorescence, yet it is unclear under which natural light environment fluorescence contributes perceptively to their colours. To address this question we: (i) characterized the visual system of               Tripterygion delaisi,               which possesses fluorescent irides, (ii) separated the colour of the irides into its reflectance and fluorescence components and (iii) combined these data with field measurements of the ambient light environment to calculate depth-dependent perceptual chromatic and achromatic contrasts using visual modelling. We found that triplefins have cones with at least three different spectral sensitivities, including differences between the two members of the double cones, giving them the potential for trichromatic colour vision. We also show that fluorescence contributes increasingly to the radiance of the irides with increasing depth. Our results support the potential functionality of red fluorescence, including communicative roles such as species and sex identity, and non-communicative roles such as camouflage.},

  abstract = {Predators are often the most vulnerable group to extinction, yet the consequences of changing predator diversity are poorly understood. One source of confusion has been different experimental designs. The multiple-predator effects literature typically employs an additive design, while the biodiversity ecosystem function literature typically uses a replacement design. Separately, these designs each detect only a subset of the changes in food web interactions caused by predator loss. Here, we measure the impact of consumer diversity on sessile marine invertebrates using a combination additive--replacement design. We couple this with a meta-analysis of previous combination experiments. We use these two approaches to explore how each design can detect different types of interactions among predators. We find that, while high diversity does lead to more negative interspecific interactions, the strength of these interactions is often weaker than negative intraspecific interactions caused by increasing the density of a single species alone. We conclude that a hybrid design is the optimal method to explore the mechanisms behind the effects of changing predator diversity. If researchers merely want to know the consequences of changing predator diversity, at a bare minimum, the experimental design must mimic the actual changes in both predator density and diversity in their system of interest. However, only a hybrid design can distinguish the consequences of shifting the balance of interspecific and intraspecific interactions within a community, an issue of great importance when considering both natural diversity loss and pest biocontrol.},

Such is the case of Acanthopleura echinata (Barnes), one of the largest and most conspicuous chitons in the world, and at the same time, one of the least known intertidal species in the southeastern Pacific. To improve the basic ecological knowledge of this potentially important intertidal consumer, we studied the diet of A. echinata and its variation among sites of varying levels of coastal upwelling spread over 1000 km along the coast of northern Chile. A seasonal evaluation of diet, body size distribution and density at sites expected to vary in overall nutrient loadings, benthic algal productivity and sea surface temperature, allowed us to examine plasticity in Acantholeura diet and body size. Overall, A. echinata consumed 85 items of algae (64.7 \%, mainly fleshy and calcified encrusting thalli) and invertebrates (35.3 \%, mainly barnacles). Diet was always dominated by encrusting corallines, although the proportion of algae increased with body size suggesting an ontogenetic variation in feeding habits. Although the number and occurrence frequency of dietary items varied significantly in time and space, there were no consistent seasonal patterns and the dominant items in the diet remained the same at all places. The density of A. echinata showed no significant spatial variation, but its body size and diet breadth correlated positively among sites and both tended to increase with latitude. Our results show that A. echinata is a generalist, polyphagous consumer with a high potential for affecting the space-occupancy dynamics in the intertidal system, and also that among site variation in diet bears no simple relationship with variation in sea surface temperature and upwelling intensity.},

  abstract = {Diverse assemblages of sessile and mobile fauna live under intertidal and subtidal boulders. When these biota are sampled, it is necessary temporarily to overturn the boulders. Many mobile species respond to overturning by moving onto the other side of the boulder or moving off the boulder into the surrounding area. Overturning without replacing a boulder has been shown to affect abundances and diversity of its sessile and mobile organisms. Overturning when sampling has, however, not previously been examined as a potential source of disturbance, because replacement of the boulders has been assumed not to disturb the organisms. These experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that sampling is a measurable disturbance to the mobile fauna and groups of sessile biota living under boulders. The sessile organisms were mainly encrusting algae, encrusting tubeworms and bryozoans, with smaller amounts of foliose algae, other colonial animals, bivalves and cnidarians. The mobile fauna were primarily large ({$>$} 5 mm long) chitons, gastropods and echinoderms. Assemblages on boulders that had been previously sampled were compared to those on undisturbed boulders. Effects of sampling on temporal changes in abundances were also compared to similar changes on sets of undisturbed boulders. There were no or very few differences in assemblages, mean densities of selected species or the proportions of boulders occupied by selected species among undisturbed boulders and boulders subjected to different frequencies of prior sampling when there were 3--4 month intervals between samples. There were, however, short-term responses to disturbance associated with sampling. These were measured as differences in densities and the proportion of boulders occupied by some species of molluscs and echinoderms and differences in the molluscan assemblage between undisturbed and disturbed, i.e. previously sampled, boulders. These differences disappeared during the following month. These data suggest that organisms on boulders are disturbed by careful sampling, but that they rapidly recover during the following few weeks. Thus, sampling is possible without altering the abundances of the target species if there is long enough between samples for the densities under the disturbed boulders to recover.},

  abstract = {Spatial and temporal patterns of abundance of animals and plants must be quantified before models to explain distributions can be developed. These patterns also provide essential data for measuring potential effects of environmental disturbances. Studies in many different habitats have shown that most organisms, particularly invertebrates, have highly variable and interactive patterns of abundance, with much variability at the smallest temporal and spatial scales. Intertidal boulder fields in New South Wales, Australia, support a diverse fauna, many species of which are relatively rare. These habitats are commonly found near rock-platforms and in sheltered estuaries and are subjected to many human disturbances. Although there have been a few studies on the fauna in boulder fields, none has documented variability of the assemblage using multivariate and univariate techniques and most studies have not incorporated different spatial and temporal scales. This study quantifies spatial variation at three scales (metres, tens of metres alongshore and tens of metres upshore) and temporal variation at two scales (3 months and 2 years) of the assemblage of molluscs and echinoderms in a sheltered boulder field subjected to little natural or human disturbance. Multivariate analyses revealed that each site contained a distinct assemblage, mainly due to the relative abundances of a few species. Most species, those generally only found under boulders and common, widespread species, had considerable spatial variability in abundances, with more than 90\% measured at the smallest scale, that is metre to metre within a site. Changes in abundances over 3 months or 2 years varied among species and sites in unpredictable ways. These data show that sampling designs to measure impacts on these fauna will need to be complex and must incorporate a number of spatial and temporal scales if they are to be able to detect impact against such a variable background.},

  abstract = {The marine mollusc Acanthopleura granulata (Mollusca; Polyplacophora) has a distributed visual array composed of hundreds of small image-forming eyes embedded within its eight dorsal shell plates. As in other animals with distributed visual systems, we still have a poor understanding of the visual capabilities of A. granulata and we have yet to learn where and how it processes visual information. Using behavioral trials involving isoluminant looming visual stimuli, we found that A. granulata demonstrates spatial vision with an angular resolution of 6 deg. We also found that A. granulata responds to looming stimuli defined by contrasting angles of linear polarization. To learn where and how A. granulata processes visual information, we traced optic nerves using fluorescent lipophilic dyes. We found that the optic nerves innervate the underlying lateral neuropil, a neural tissue layer that circumnavigates the body. Adjacent optic nerves innervate the lateral neuropil with highly overlapping arborizations, suggesting it is the site of an integrated visuotopic map. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that the lateral neuropil of A. granulata is subdivided into two separate layers. In comparison, we found that a chiton with eyespots (Chiton tuberculatus) and two eyeless chitons (Ischnochiton papillosus and Chaetopleura apiculata) have lateral neuropil that is a singular circular layer without subdivision, findings consistent with previous work on chiton neuroanatomy. Overall, our results suggest that A. granulata effectuates its visually mediated behaviors using a unique processing scheme: it extracts spatial and polarization information using a distributed visual system, and then integrates and processes that information using decentralized neural circuits.},

Both species feed during nocturnal low tide and rest during the day and high tide. Due to this activity rhythm, individual positions recorded during diurnal and nocturnal low tides give information on the rest habits of the chitons and on their movements, respectively. The resting and feeding fixes were analyzed with two new complementary methods. Both species show a distinct homing behaviour with periodical shift to new homes more frequent in A. brevispinosa than in A. gemmata. The latter species shows a stronger constancy to its feeding ground. The two species differ most in the orientation and length of their excursions. Due to their different movement pattern the two species minimize zonal overlapping during the night, which in turn reduces the interspecific competition for food.},

The absorption of Chl-a and Cars are linearly dependent on intrinsic factors, namely effective conjugate length and functional groups, and on environmental factors, such as the polarizability of the solvent. Cars can be able to quench the Chl-a fluorescence by producing the non-emitting exciplex intermediate. The effective conjugated length of Cars is one of the reasons that effect the fluorescence quenching of Chl-a. According to the Stern-Volmer plots, the Chl-a fluorescence quenching should be predominantly dynamic rather than static.},

  abstract = {Chitons of the genus Ischnochiton are found predominantly on the undersurfaces of boulders, compared with other intertidal or subtidal habitats. They therefore appear to be habitat-specialists at this scale. This, combined with the fact that boulder fields are relatively sparse compared with other intertidal habitats, makes these animals vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. In addition, many species of Ischnochiton are relatively rare and appear to have very patchy abundances, making them likely to have very specific requirements for habitat. We need to understand the habitat requirements in order to manage, conserve and restore disturbed habitats.The present study was carried out at three intertidal boulder fields separated along approximately 200 km of the coast of New South Wales, Australia, centred around Sydney. The boulder fields were representative of those found in this region. The boulders were made of different materials: shale in the north, sandstone in Sydney and quartzitic sandstone in the south. Some boulders in each boulder field were covered by up to 0.4 m of water during low tide. The study showed that the seven species examined were overdispersed among boulders in each of these three intertidal boulder fields. Most boulders did not have associated chitons, but there were very large abundances on a very small number of boulders. Chitons were also overdispersed among boulders that they occupied. These patterns were consistent among shores and among species, even though patterns of abundance were extremely different among different species. These species appear therefore to show specific requirements for habitat at a small spatial scale, using only a small proportion of potential patches of habitat (i.e. boulders) in any place. Extremely patchy patterns of dispersion can be caused by variation in patterns of recruitment, mortality or behavioural responses to habitat or other species. Before performing experiments to investigate such processes, it is useful to test hypotheses of association with habitat using mensurative experiments to identify environmental correlates that might explain the observed patterns. In the present study, sizes of boulders and the associated sessile and mobile assemblages were proposed as mechanisms that could affect dispersion of chitons among boulders. None of these factors, however, showed strong associations with abundances of chitons. The lack of support of these models rules out some features of habitat to which species of Ischnochiton might respond, thereby precluding manipulative experiments involving these features, which are unlikely to be involved in the very patchy patterns of dispersion of species of Ischnochiton.},

  abstract = {Biofluorescence is apparently widespread in the tree of life. Fluorescence has the potential to contribute to the totality of light leaving an organism's surface and will therefore circumscribe how an individual could be detected and discriminated by their visual predators. Here, we: (i) documented the first record of biofluorescence on polyplacophorans, (ii) spectrally characterized the biofluorescence on shells of living chitons, (iii) measured the colour patch pattern variation, (iv) separated the colour of their shells into their reflectance and fluorescence components, and (v) combined these data with field measurements to calculate perceptual distance in chromatic and achromatic contrasts based on the visual system of their major visually guided predators. We found a red biofluorescence that enhances the brightness of chiton shells, along with a correlation showing that as individuals grow larger, the fluorescing surface area becomes smaller. Our visual models suggest that fluorescence decreases the achromatic contrast of chitons against their naturally fluorescent substrates for most visual predators, making them less noticeable to specific predators. Our results support the potential visual functionality of biofluorescence and open new hypotheses regarding its ecological roles to further investigations.},

  abstract = {Although proteins in the green fluorescent protein family (GFPs) have been discovered in a wide array of taxa, their ecological functions in these organisms remain unclear. Many hypothesized roles are related to modifying bioluminescence spectra or modulating the light regime for algal symbionts, but these do not explain the presence of GFPs in animals that are non-luminous and non-symbiotic. Other hypothesized functions are unrelated to the visual signals themselves, including stress responses and antioxidant roles, but these cannot explain the localization of fluorescence in particular structures on the animals. Here we tested the hypothesis that fluorescence might serve to attract prey. In laboratory experiments, the predator was the hydromedusa Olindias formosus ( previously known as O. formosa), which has fluorescent and pigmented patches on the tips of its tentacles. The prey, juvenile rockfishes in the genus Sebastes, were significantly more attracted (P{$<$}1{\texttimes}10-5) to the medusa's tentacles under lighting conditions where fluorescence was excited and tentacle tips were visible above the background. The fish did not respond significantly when treatments did not include fluorescent structures or took place under yellow or white lights, which did not generate fluorescence visible above the ambient light. Furthermore, underwater observations of the behavior of fishes when presented with a brightly illuminated point showed a strong attraction to this visual stimulus. In situ observations also provided evidence for fluorescent lures as supernormal stimuli in several other marine animals, including the siphonophore Rhizophysa eysenhardti. Our results support the idea that fluorescent structures can serve as prey attractants, thus providing a potential function for GFPs and other fluorescent proteins in a diverse range of organisms.},

  abstract = {Background:{\enspace} Natural red fluorescence is particularly conspicuous in the eyes of some small, benthic, predatory fishes. Fluorescence also increases in relative efficiency with increasing depth, which has generated speculation about its possible function as a ``light organ'' to detect cryptic organisms under bluish light. Here we investigate whether foraging success is improved under ambient conditions that make red fluorescence stand out more, using the triplefin Tripterygion delaisi as a model system. We repeatedly presented 10 copepods to individual fish (n = 40) kept under a narrow blue-green spectrum and compared their performance with that under a broad spectrum with the same overall brightness. The experiment was repeated for two levels of brightness, a shaded one representing 0.4\% of the light present at the surface and a heavily shaded one with about 0.01\% of the surface brightness. Results:{\enspace} Fish were 7\% more successful at catching copepods under the narrow, fluorescence-friendly spectrum than under the broad spectrum. However, this effect was significant under the heavily shaded light treatment only. Conclusions:{\enspace} This outcome corroborates previous predictions that fluorescence may be an adaptation to bluegreen, heavily shaded environments, which coincides with the opportunistic biology of this species that lives in the transition zone between exposed and heavily shaded microhabitats.},

  abstract = {Flower fluorescence has been previously proposed as a potential visual signal to attract pollinators. In this work, this point was addressed by quantitatively measuring the fluorescence quantum yield ({$\Phi$}f) for flowers of Bellis perennis (white, yellow, pink, and purple), Ornithogalum thyrsoides (petals and ovaries), Limonium sinuatum (white and yellow), Lampranthus productus (yellow), Petunia nyctaginiflora (white), Bougainvillea spectabilis (white and yellow), Antirrhinum majus (white and yellow), Eustoma grandiflorum (white and blue), Citrus aurantium (petals and stigma), and Portulaca grandiflora (yellow). The highest values were obtained for the ovaries of O. thyrsoides ({$\Phi$}f=0.030) and for Citrus aurantium petals ({$\Phi$}f=0.014) and stigma ({$\Phi$}f=0.013). Emitted photons as fluorescence were compared with reflected photons. It was concluded that the fluorescence emission is negligible compared to the reflected light, even for the most fluorescent samples, and it may not be considered as an optical signal in biocommunication. The work was complemented with the calculation of quantum catches for each studied flower species to describe the visual sensitization of eye photoreceptors.},

  abstract = {Many marine fishes show conspicuous red fluorescent body patterns. Recent work suggests that red fluorescence may be used as a visual colour cue in these species. Very few studies, however, have as yet been able to demonstrate that red fluorescent fish can actually perceive their own fluorescence. This is the first study to our knowledge in which a red fluorescent fish is trained to assess whether it can recognize red fluorescence. We used the triplefin Tripterygion delaisi, a species with conspicuous red fluorescent eye rings. Training and testing involved repeated binary choices between grey and red fluorescence cues. The training and testing were carried out under broad spectral illumination. The final testing phase involved cyan light illumination, mimicking natural ambient light at depth. When testing all nine combinations of three grey brightness levels against three red fluorescence brightness levels, individuals made significantly more correct choices than the random expectation under broad as well as cyan illumination. Under cyan illumination, fish trained on red chose the correct cue more often compared to fish trained on grey. An analysis of the effect of the brightness levels suggests that fish did indeed make their choices based on chromatic more than achromatic cues: The three grey levels did not affect the proportion of correct choices. We conclude that T. delaisi can perceive and respond to levels of fluorescence that are similar to its own. We also discuss the difficulties that can arise from using a binary choice design on a fish with a cryptobenthic lifestyle. We argue in favour of using sequential choice designs in future studies of T. delaisi.},

  abstract = {To better understand relationships between the structures and functions of the distributed visual systems of chitons, we compare how morphological differences between the light-sensing structures of these animals relate to their visually guided behaviors. All chitons have sensory organs -- termed aesthetes -- embedded within their protective shell plates. In some species, the aesthetes are interspersed with small, image-forming eyes. In other species, the aesthetes are paired with pigmented eyespots. Previously, we compared the visually influenced behaviors of chitons with aesthetes to those of chitons with both aesthetes and eyes. Here, we characterize the visually influenced behaviors of chitons with aesthetes and eyespots. We find that chitons with eyespots engage in behaviors consistent with spatial vision, but appear to use spatial vision for different tasks than chitons with eyes. Unlike chitons with eyes, Chiton tuberculatus and C. marmoratus fail to distinguish between sudden appearances of overhead objects and equivalent, uniform changes in light levels. We also find that C. tuberculatus orients to static objects with angular sizes as small as 10 deg. Thus, C. tuberculatus demonstrates spatial resolution that is at least as fine as that demonstrated by chitons with eyes. The eyespots of Chiton are smaller and more numerous than the eyes found in other chitons and they are separated by angles of {$<$}0.5 deg, suggesting that the light-influenced behaviors of Chiton may be more accurately predicted by the network properties of their distributed visual system than by the structural properties of their individual light-detecting organs.},

So far, the best-known attractants in carnivorous prey traps are nectar, colour and olfactory cues. Here, fresh prey traps of 14 Nepenthes, five Sarracenia, five Drosera, two Pinguicula species/ hybrids, Dionaea muscipula and Utricularia stellaris were scanned at UV 366 nm. Fluorescence emissions of major isolates of fresh Nepenthes khasiana pitcher peristomes were recorded at an excitation wavelength of 366 nm. N. khasiana field pitcher peristomes were masked by its slippery zone extract, and prey capture rates were compared with control pitchers. We found the existence of distinct blue fluorescence emissions at the capture spots of Nepenthes, Sarracenia and Dionaea prey traps at UV 366 nm. These alluring blue emissions gradually developed with the growth of the prey traps and diminished towards their death. On excitation at 366 nm, N. khasiana peristome 3:1 CHCl3--MeOH extract and its two major blue bands showed strong fluorescence emissions at 430--480 nm. Masking of blue emissions on peristomes drastically reduced prey capture in N. khasiana pitchers. We propose these molecular emissions as a critical factor attracting arthropods and other visitors to these carnivorous traps. Drosera, Pinguicula and Utricularia prey traps showed only red chlorophyll emissions at 366 nm.},

  abstract = {Low-midshore boulder fields in Europe are increasingly subject to degradation related to beach fishing for crabs and abalones. The aim of the study was to better understand the structure and species diversity of macrofaunal assemblages living in a low-midshore boulder field in order to define conservation strategies for this biotope. Sampling strategy involved different spatial scales (`macro-' and `microstrata') relative to the complexity and heterogeneity of the habitat. Assemblages of species and the corresponding habitats were identified by multifactorial analysis and compared by ANOVAs. The results show a hierarchical organization of the macrofauna within the boulder field, corresponding to three spatial levels of habitat structure: (i) eight `microhabitats' at the lowest level of spatial organization, each defined by a specific assemblage (subcommunity); (ii) three `habitats' at a middle level combining these microhabitats, each associated with a specific community (open rock, protected rock and sediment); and (iii) three `macrohabitats' at the uppermost level (corresponding to the scale of the entire boulder field and including the main geomorphological features of the beach), each defined by a specific assemblage of species (boulders on boulders, boulders on bedrock, and boulders on sediment). Two microhabitats with particularly high species diversity were regarded as the most important ecological units of the field in terms of conservation of specific and functional biodiversity. Comparison of habitat/community parameters showed (i) that habitat heterogeneity was not an accurate indicator of faunal diversity, and (ii) that habitat complexity enhanced the species richness of the fauna, but only above a threshold value. This enhancement was due to semi-sheltered microhabitats, which were found only in the most complex areas of the boulder field. It is likely that this complexity affects species richness qualitatively more than by the diversity of microhabitats. In other words, a cross-scale effect is apparent in which high habitat complexity on the middle spatial scale creates microhabitats on the lowest spatial scale that are characterized by stable semi-sheltered environmental conditions conducive to a maximum of species.},

We show that the foraging patterns of both species are constrained by 1.(1) the probability of predation by fishes,2.(2) overheating and desiccation. Their different responses to these factors control their effects on the rest of the intertidal community. Both species are found in a limited number of microhabitats while inactive. N. funiculata is restricted to mid-zone crevices. Individuals forage out from these crevices for short periods on ebbing or rising tides. Movement is limited to {$\approx$}50 cm on either side of occupied crevices. The rock within {$\approx$}10 cm from crevices containing N. funiculata is bare; crustose algal cover increases with distance from the crevice. There is no change in algal cover with distance around crevices which naturally lack N. funiculata and in experimental removals algal crusts settle or grow in to cover 80--100\% of the rock. Thus N. funiculata affects local, discrete areas of intertidal substratum by causing small-scale patchiness in algal cover. N. scabricosta is found at upper tidal levels while inactive during high tide, aggregated above the high-water mark in crevices or on vertical surfaces. Individuals move down and graze from the high to the low zones as the tide falls. They retreat to the high intertidal zone as the tide rises and once again become inactive until the tide falls. Thus, unlike its congener, N. scabricosta exerts grazing effects throughout the intertidal zone. We demonstrate that this snail affects 1.(1) barnacle settlement,2.(2) the density and size structure of co-occurring species of Littorina,3.(3) the abundance of crustose algae from the high to the low mid-zones. These differences in community effects between species appear to be related to the larger body size reached by N. scabricosta.},

We use optical experiments to demonstrate that these microscopic lenses are able to form images. Light scattering by the polycrystalline lenses is minimized by the use of relatively large, crystallographically-aligned grains. Multi-scale mechanical testing reveals that as the size, complexity, and functionality of the integrated sensory elements increases, the local mechanical performance of the armor decreases. However, A. granulata has evolved several strategies to compensate for its mechanical vulnerabilities to form a multi-purpose system with cooptimized optical and structural functions.},

  abstract = {While bryozoans are important components of marine benthic ecosystems, their significance as food has scarcely been considered in any comparative study. An analysis of the phylogenetic range of predators on bryozoan colonies was undertaken to elucidate relationships among different consumers. Functional feeding traits and diet categories were determined from literature sources and observations for 399 predator species. Multivariate analyses were used to identify groups of species that consume similar food resources and have related functional traits corresponding to finding, acquiring and ingesting prey. These analyses distinguished gradients among trophic groups based on dissimilar feeding mechanisms, body sizes, types of locomotion and dietary breadths. Co-occurrences of certain diet categories also emerged as important factors. Trophic groups were largely consistent with species clusters at different taxonomic ranks among the predator phyla. At one extreme, fishes and decapod crustaceans with large dietary breadths and body sizes, and crushing or tearing feeding mechanisms, appear to consume bryozoans as minor or even incidental parts of their diets. At another extreme, species of nudibranchs, pycnogonids, turbellarians, and certain polychaetes, small arthropods and nematodes that consume bryozoans do so primarily or exclusively. Their body sizes are comparatively smaller and they often have piercing and suctorial feeding mechanisms. These differences are associated by inference with different probabilities of antagonistic encounters and likelihoods of lethal or sublethal predation. The analyses provide a baseline for ecological and evolutionary comparisons, and a broader context for the questions, `Who eats bryozoans, how, and how frequently?'.},

Despite this area has been created more than two decades ago, no study has provided knowledge on the invertebrate biodiversity associated with such reef ecosystems. The present investigation provides the first inventory of benthic mollusks associated with the reef ecosystems of Morro de S{\~a}o Paulo based on the collection of living specimens and fresh empty as well as some worn shells. Mollusks were sampled in January 2015 and August 2016 through intensive searches from the intertidal to shallow subtidal habitats of the reefs on three beaches of Morro de S{\~a}o Paulo. Taxonomic richness and biodiversity indices were analyzed. This rapid assessment of the malacofauna resulted in the determination of 84 species belonging to 44 families of gastropods as well as 13 species belonging to eight families of bivalves and one chiton (total: 98 species). Species richness was numerically dominated by members of the subclass Caenogastropoda. The families with the largest number of species were Ranellidae (5), Muricidae (6) and Marginellidae (7). Conus regius, Cypraecassis testiculus, Lobatus goliath, Strombus pugilis, Tonna galea, Turbinella laevigata and Vasum cassiforme are extremely vulnerable macrospecies in the region due to their commercial importance. Comparisons of the malacofauna composition between the study site and Abrolhos Bank were made from data published for this region. ACE and CHAO 1 estimated 133 mollusk species for the region. Despite the rapid assessment, the number of species discovered in the study area approached 73.6\% of the estimated total number. The considerable number of mollusk species found in a relatively small area with insufficient sampling underscores the importance of the reef ecosystems of Morro de S{\~a}o Paulo as a one priority area for conservation on the coast of the state of Bahia, Brazil, for which the species richness of other invertebrate groups is virtually unknown.},

  abstract = {The intimate association between a selective herbivore (the chiton Choneplax lata) and its primary prey (the crustose coralline alga Porolithon pachydermum) results in increased biomass and accretion of the alga. This process, over ecological and geological time scales, comprises a major component of Caribbean reef-building systems. Manipulative experiments showed that as the chiton grazes the alga it stimulates new meristematic activity and removes sporlings of the competitively superior frondose and filamentous algae, thereby increasing the survival rate of P. pachydermum on the intertidal reef crest. Furthermore, in the absence of C. lata, overgrowths of frondose and filamentous epiphytes provide an attractive food source for parrotfishes (Scaridae), which accelerates bioerosion of the coralline reef-crest structure due to the deep rasping action of feeding activity. Algal removal experiments suggest that the role of P. pachydermum is to provide a predictable food source and refuge substratum, which increases survivorship of the burrowing chiton by minimizing expenditure of energy during foraging and risk to predation. The chiton/coralline alga association is abundant throughout tropical western Atlantic islands and augments reef-building processes on the shallow algal crest portion of Caribbean reefs. Cover of the Choneplax/Porolithon association in the Belize Barrier Reef crest averages 13\% (maximum to 70\%) with a mean chiton density of 664 individuals/m2 within the association. On average, the extensive networks of interconnected chiton burrows extend between 6 and 10 cm deep and contain one C. lata for every six openings, with the majority of animals (66\%) ranging from 16 to 30 mm in length. Gut contents of the chiton consist predominantly of P. pachydermum (51\%), followed by bacterial detritus (30\%), Cyanophyta (13\%), Bacillariophyta (3\%), and fleshy microalgae (3\%). The close SEM (scanning electron microscope) match between radular morphology of C. lata and grazing scars on the thallus surface of P. pachydermum shows how the chiton regularly feeds on the coralline alga without causing mortality. Virtually all P. pachydermum in the vicinity of C. lata burrows contain radular track scars of 10 JImin depth, whereas the photosynthetic, meristematic, and reproductive tissues of the coralline lie below 20 KIm.P. pachydermum under intense chiton grazing is photosynthetically competent with 0.1 mg C fixed {$\cdot$} g-{\textasciitilde} organic dry mass-h-1, which is not significantly different from ungrazed material and within the range of rates for other crustose coralline algae. The result is continuous net accretion at a mean rate of 2.3 mm/yr.},

We used micro-computed tomography combined with quantitative image analysis to reveal the optimized shell geometry to resist force and the aesthetes' global distribution at the whole animal levels to facilitate sense from diverse directions both in the seawater and air. Additionally, shell proteomics combined with transcriptome reveals shell matrix proteins responsible for shell construction and potentially sensory function, highlighting unique cadherin-related proteins among mollusca.

  abstract = {Studies investigating the many ecologically and economically important species in benthic boulder habitats often use artificial boulders for determining species colonization. In some cases square-edged blocks are used that are shaped much differently than the ovoid or `round' boulders often occurring naturally. Here it was tested if the shape of boulders affects the distribution across the boulder surface of crustose coralline algae (CCA), a taxon that strongly influences ecological dynamics in this habitat. The distance that CCA extends from the edge of boulders toward the centre of the underside was measured, and it was found that CCA extended further underneath boulders that were round-shaped compared with those that were block-shaped, probably because of light reaching further underneath round boulders. This result shows how at least one important taxon can be affected by variation in the shape of these boulders. Hypotheses being tested that use artificial substrata to model naturally occurring boulders should be carried out only in places where the artificial and naturally occurring boulders match physically.},

  abstract = {There are numerous examples of non-indigenous rocky-intertidal mobile invertebrate species, but there have been very few instances of introductions of chitons despite their often high abundance in fouling assemblages where non-indigenous species originate. In 2016, it was observed incidentally that the snake-skin chiton Sypharochiton pelliserpentis, native to eastern Australia and New Zealand, was occurring in Coffin Bay in western South Australia, which is a sheltered bay used for oyster farming and far outside the previously documented S. pelliserpentis range. The main coastal water currents in the region flow from west to east, meaning natural larval dispersal into Coffin Bay from eastern Australian populations is unlikely. Surveys of population and community dynamics done in 2018 revealed that a large population has established with the non-native chiton far outnumbering a comparable native chiton (Plaxiphora albida) that may occupy a similar niche space. The chitons occurred on exposed bedrock habitats as well as cryptic habitats underneath boulders; both species were equally abundant between these habitats except at one site where S. pelliserpentis densities specifically underneath boulders were 10 times greater than other habitat-types or sites. Sypharochiton pelliserpentis in its native range can largely impact sessile assemblages; here we tested the hypothesis that sessile assemblages would differ on boulders with versus without the non-native chiton, but no evidence of any such effect was found. Sypharochiton pellisperpentis is a common epibiont of oyster-reefs and the origin of its introduction into South Australia may involve transport of oyster-industry materials, which was how introductions of four other non-native benthic invertebrates occurred previously into another Australian region. The geographic extent of S. pelliserpentis in South Australia is unknown at this stage but the chiton was not found during surveys in another nearby bay. Knowledge that oyster-associated chitons may be spreading outside their native ranges, and that they can establish primarily in habitats that are largely hidden from view, such as underneath boulders, can inform monitoring and management practices for ecology of non-indigenous intertidal species.},

While many underlying mechanistic features have been identified and characterized at the molecular and cellular levels, much less is known about the ecology and evolution of these forms of bioluminescence. In this review, we summarize recent findings in the evolutionary history and ecological functions of fluorescent proteins (FP) and pigments. Evidence for green fluorescent protein (GFP) orthologs in cephalochordates and non-GFP fluorescent proteins in vertebrates suggests unexplored evolutionary scenarios that favor multiple independent origins of fluorescence across metazoan lineages. Several context-dependent behavioral and physiological roles have been attributed to fluorescent proteins, ranging from communication and predation to UV protection. However, rigorous functional and mechanistic studies are needed to shed light on the ecological functions and control mechanisms of fluorescence.},

  abstract = {Fluorescence is a physico-chemical energy exchange where shorter-wavelength photons are absorbed by a molecule and are re-emitted as longer-wavelength photons. It has been suggested a means of communication in several taxa including flowers, pitcher plants, corals, algae, worms, squid, spiders, stomatopods, fish, reptiles, parrots and humans. The surface or object that the pigment molecule is part of appears to glow due to its setting rather than an actual production of light, and this may enhance both signals and, in some cases, camouflage. This review examines some known uses of fluorescence, mainly in the context of visual communication in animals, the challenge being to distinguish when fluorescence is a functional feature of biological coloration or when it is a by-product of a pigment or other molecule. In general, we conclude that most observations of fluorescence lack enough evidence to suggest they are used in visually driven behaviours.

  abstract = {The environment plays a significant role in shaping the visibility of signals both to and from an organism. For example, against a static background movement is highly conspicuous, which favours staying still to optimize camouflage. However, backgrounds can also be highly dynamic, such as areas with wind-blown foliage or frequent changes in illumination. We propose that these dynamic features act as visual noise which could serve to mask otherwise conspicuous movement. Two forms of illumination change were simulated, water caustics and dappled light, to represent dynamic aquatic and terrestrial environments, respectively. When asked to capture moving prey items within the simulated scenes, human participants were significantly slower and more error prone when viewing scenes with dynamic illumination. This effect was near identical for both the aquatic and terrestrial environments. In the latter, prey item movement was also found to be masked most often when the pathway taken involved movement across the dynamic dappled areas of the scene. This could allow particularly moving prey to reduce their signal-to-noise ratio by behaviourally favouring the relative safety of environments containing dynamic features.},

  abstract = {Gregarious settlement, an essential behavior for many barnacle species that can only reproduce by mating with a nearby barnacle, has long been thought to rely on larval ability to recognize chemical signals from conspecifics during settlement. However, the cyprid, the settlement stage larva in barnacles, has one pair of compound eyes that appear only at the late nauplius VI and cyprid stages, but the function(s) of these eyes remains unknown. Here we show that cyprids of the intertidal barnacle Balanus (=Amphibalanus) amphitrite can locate adult barnacles even in the absence of chemical cues, and prefer to settle around them probably via larval sense of vision. We also show that the cyprids can discriminate color and preferred to settle on red surfaces. Moreover, we found that shells of adult B. amphitrite emit red auto-fluorescence and the adult extracts with the fluorescence as a visual signal attracted cyprid larvae to settle around it. We propose that the perception of specific visual signals can be involved in behavior of zooplankton including marine invertebrate larvae, and that barnacle auto-fluorescence may be a specific signal involved in gregarious larval settlement.},

An unexpected finding was that fluorescent proteins might also make corals appear less colorful to fish, counterbalancing the effect of absorption by the photosynthetic pigments of the endosymbiotic algae, which might be a form of protection against herbivores. We conclude that GFP-determined coloration of corals may be an important factor in visual ecology of the reef fishes.},

Whereas the photoprotection hypothesis predicts fluorescence to be stronger near the surface and weaker in deeper water, the visual contrast hypothesis predicts the opposite. We used fluorometry to measure red fluorescence brightness in vivo in individuals belonging to eight common small reef fish species with conspicuously red fluorescent eyes. Fluorescence was significantly brighter in specimens from the -20 m sites than in those from --- 5m sites in six out of eight species. No difference was found in the remaining two.

Time-search transects were conducted on four Portuguese rocky shores at two shore levels. The chiton species, abundance and individual morphometric features were recorded and related to the substratum dominant epiphytes and surface roughness. The chiton Lepidochitona cinerea (Linnaeus 1767) was the dominant species (77\%), followed by Leptochiton algesirensis (Capellini 1859) (15\%) and Acanthochitona crinita (Pennant 1777) (8\%). Species abundance did not vary significantly with shore level or amongst shores. Six colour morphs were considered for Lepidochitona cinerea, four for A. crinita and one for Lepidochiton algesirensis. Substratum characteristics significantly explained the variation in species and colour morph distribution. There was a high correlation between the presence/absence and type of epiphytic algae and the substratum surface roughness level. We hypothesize that three mechanisms operating either independently or in interaction may explain the non-random distribution of colour polymorphisms according to their habitat characteristics: (i) presence of algae that are part of their diet; (ii) use of rock as shelter -- for instance, crevices and cover resulting from algae fronds and; (iii) morph--rock colour matching as a camouflage mechanism to reduce predation pressure.},

Bright irides in diurnal fish species have recently been proposed as a potential analogue. Here, we contribute to this discussion by testing whether iris radiance is actively modulated. The focus is on behaviourally controlled iris reflections, called `ocular sparks'. The triplefin Tripterygion delaisi can alternate between red and blue ocular sparks, allowing us to test the prediction that spark frequency and hue depend on background hue and prey presence. In a first experiment, we found that blue ocular sparks were significantly more often `on' against red backgrounds, and red ocular sparks against blue backgrounds, particularly when copepods were present. A second experiment tested whether hungry fish showed more ocular sparks, which was not the case. However, background hue once more resulted in a significant differential use of ocular sparks. We conclude that iris radiance through ocular sparks in T. delaisi is not a side effect of eye movement, but adaptively modulated in response to the context under which prey are detected. We discuss the possible alternative functions of ocular sparks, including an as yet speculative role in active photolocation.},

Together with other sensory cues and physiological conditions, the visual environment sets behavioral states that make the animal more prone to engage in some behaviors, and less in others. This master-control of behavior serves a fundamental and essential role in determining the distribution and behavior of all animals. Although it is obvious that visual information contains vital input for setting behavioral states, the precise nature of these visual cues remains unknown. Here we use a recently described method to quantify the distribution of light reaching animals' eyes in different environments. The method records the vertical gradient (as a function of elevation angle) of intensity, spatial structure and spectral balance. Comparison of measurements from different types of environments, weather conditions, times of day, and seasons reveal that these aspects can be readily discriminated from one another. The vertical gradients of radiance, spatial structure (contrast) and color are thus reliable indicators that are likely to have a strong impact on animal behavior and spatial distribution.},

  abstract = {Many species are aggregated at some spatial scale but for some species, due to habitat or behaviour, aggregation can be difficult to assess quantitatively. Here, aggregation of chiton species (Polyplacophora; Neoloricata; Ischnochitonina; Ischnochitonidae; Ischnochitoninae; Ischnochiton) living under boulders in intertidal boulder fields was investigated at several relatively small spatial scales. Closely related species were found to be aggregated at the level of individual boulders, but evidence for grouping at the larger scale of patches of boulders varied.When organisms are mobile, dispersal can have an important influence on spatial patterns. Some organisms, such as marine invertebrates, have a highly dispersive larval phase that can influence spatial patterns of adults, particularly where the adult is sessile or relatively sedentary. Aggregation was compared in two species to test whether different modes of larval development influence spatial pattern.There was some evidence that species with a planktonic larva were even more aggregated than expected, in contrast to predictions based on this mode of development. Both types of larval development (planktonic and non-planktonic) produce larvae with short development times in these species, so one possible explanation for the grouping habit of these chitons is that they do not disperse, at all, from their natal boulder. The complexity of the boulder field habitat and the cryptic behaviour of these chitons may also contribute to a lack of dispersal. A simple application of a genetic method indicated, however, that philopatry at this scale is unlikely.},

The Cambrian stage of molluscan evolution is characterized based on the paleontological material. The doubtfulness of assignment of the Precambrian (Vendian) soft-bodied fossil Kimberella to mollusks is argued. Judging from the interpretation of the morphologically diverse Cambrian fossils, it is suggested that the classes Polyplacophora, Monoplacophora, Gastropoda and Bivalvia formed already near the Precambrian--Cambrian boundary, i.e., from the beginning of the paleontologically documented evolutionary history of the phylum, whereas the assumption of the later origin of these taxa is unconvincing. The remaining classes of mollusks arose later, i.e., Cephalopoda, in the Late Cambrian; Scaphopoda, in the Ordovician; and Aplacophora, in the Silurian.},

  abstract = {Vision allows animals to detect spatial differences in environmental light levels. High-resolution image-forming eyes evolved from low-resolution eyes via increases in photoreceptor cell number, improvements in optics and changes in the neural circuits that process spatially resolved photoreceptor input. However, the evolutionary origins of the first low-resolution visual systems have been unclear. We propose that the lowest resolving (two-pixel) visual systems could initially have functioned in visual phototaxis. During visual phototaxis, such elementary visual systems compare light on either side of the body to regulate phototactic turns. Another, even simpler and non-visual strategy is characteristic of helical phototaxis, mediated by sensory--motor eyespots. The recent mapping of the complete neural circuitry (connectome) of an elementary visual system in the larva of the annelid Platynereis dumerilii sheds new light on the possible paths from non-visual to visual phototaxis and to image-forming vision. We outline an evolutionary scenario focusing on the neuronal circuitry to account for these transitions. We also present a comprehensive review of the structure of phototactic eyes in invertebrate larvae and assign them to the non-visual and visual categories. We propose that non-visual systems may have preceded visual phototactic systems in evolution that in turn may have repeatedly served as intermediates during the evolution of image-forming eyes.},

Metamorphosis, which involves the loss of the prototrochal ciliary band, occurred within a period of 2.5 h after larvae began crawling upon the alga. In response to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at a concentration of 10-6M, the lecithotrophic trochophore larvae ceased swimming and settled rapidly. Developmental metamorphosis did not follow settlement in the absence of encrusting coralline alga. However, when both GABA and Lithothamnium sp. were present, larval metamorphosis occurred within 2 h of settlement. Significantly different rates of settlement exist for sibling larvae of different ages; 12 d-old larvae responded more rapily and in greater numbers to treatment with GABA than 10 d-old larvae. Differences in settling rates are attributed to the onset of metamorphic competence.},

Morphological examination of this new material reveals the presence of two species. N. lineata is distinct from N. andamanica (Smith, 1906), based on morphological characters given in the original species description and very distinctly different morphology of aesthete pores in the shell surface. Furthermore, populations of N. andamanica in the Philippines and Solomon Islands are locally colonized with the epibiotic (ectoparasitic) bryozoan Pseudobathyalozoon profundum d'Hondt, 2006. These bryozoans attach ventrally to the girdle of the host chiton and the erect zooids feed within the pallial cavity, among the chiton's gills.},

These include: detrivores, herbivores, omnivorous grazers, carnivorous grazers, specialist spongivores, epizoophagous feeders, xylophagous wood-dwelling species and true predators. The majority of species among common intertidal chitons appear to be omnivorous grazers. Here, we examined the gut morphology, and radula morphology, in species from various feeding types. The proportionate length and mineralization of the radula are not strongly correlated with feeding type, but these characteristics could be refined and later used to exclude particular habits where no other ecological data are available. Gut length in chitons follows classical gut foreshortening, with ambush predators having a short intestinal tract forming a single major loop, whereas obligate herbivores having dramatically long intestinal lengths with multiple coilings. Multiple feeding strategies, and concomitant adaptation of the digestive system, can be observed among phylogenetically closely-related taxa. Niche partitioning through dietary specialization, even among co-occurring omnivorous grazers, may speculatively underpin the success of chitons in the Northeast Pacific and other regions.},

Whereas the majority of fluorescent proteins have been identified from cnidarians, recently several fluorescent proteins have been isolated across the animal tree of life. Here we show that biofluorescence is not only phylogenetically widespread, but is also phenotypically variable across both cartilaginous and bony fishes, highlighting its evolutionary history and the possibility for discovery of numerous novel fluorescent proteins. Fish biofluorescence is especially common and morphologically variable in cryptically patterned coralreef lineages. We identified 16 orders, 50 families, 105 genera, and more than 180 species of biofluorescent fishes. We have also reconstructed our current understanding of the phylogenetic distribution of biofluorescence for ray-finned fishes. The presence of yellow long-pass intraocular filters in many biofluorescent fish lineages and the substantive color vision capabilities of coral-reef fishes suggest that they are capable of detecting fluoresced light. We present species-specific emission patterns among closely related species, indicating that biofluorescence potentially functions in intraspecific communication and evidence that fluorescence can be used for camouflage. This research provides insight into the distribution, evolution, and phenotypic variability of biofluorescence in marine lineages and examines the role this variation may play.},

These ocelli each contain a pigment layer, retina, and lens [2], but it is unknown whether they provide chitons with spatial vision [3]. It is also unclear whether chiton lenses are made from proteins, like nearly all biological lenses, or from some other material [4]. Electron probe X-ray microanalysis and X-ray diffraction revealed that the chiton Acanthopleura granulata has the first aragonite lenses ever discovered. We found that these lenses allow A. granulata's ocelli to function as small camera eyes with an angular resolution of about 9 --12 . Animals responded to the sudden appearance of black, overhead circles with an angular size of 9 , but not to equivalent, uniform decreases in the downwelling irradiance. Our behavioral estimates of angular resolution were consistent with estimates derived from focal length and receptor spacing within the A. granulata eye. Behavioral trials further indicated that A. granulata's eyes provide the same angular resolution in both air and water. We propose that one of the two refractive indices of the birefringent chiton lens places a focused image on the retina in air, whereas the other does so in water.},

Our aim was to better characterize the vision and visual ecology of this unusual visual system. We tested animal orientation relative to vertical bar stimuli at a range of angular widths and contrasts, to identify limits of angular and contrast detection. We also presented dynamic shadow stimuli, either looming towards or passing the animal overhead, to test for potential defensive responses. Finally, we presented animals lacking a single arm with a vertical bar stimulus known to elicit a response in intact animals. We found that O. wendtii orients to large ({$\geq$}50\>deg), high-contrast vertical bar stimuli, consistent with a shelter-seeking role and with photoreceptor acceptance angles estimated from morphology. We calculate poor optical sensitivity for individual photoreceptors, and predict dramatic oversampling for photoreceptor arrays. We also report responses to dark stimuli moving against a bright background -- this is the first report of responses to moving stimuli in brittle stars and suggests additional defensive uses for vision in echinoderms. Finally, we found that animals missing a single arm orient less well to static stimuli, which requires further investigation.},

We show that fluorescence contributes 18-29\% of the total emerging light under twilight and nocturnal scenarios, largely enhancing brightness of the individuals and matching the sensitivity of night vision in amphibians.

  abstract = {Biofluorescence, the ability to absorb light and reemit it at a longer wavelength, is present in many taxa but has been examined only recently in amphibians. Over half of the studies documenting biofluorescence in the last century suggest this fluorescent signal may affect predation; however, to date, only one other experimental study has tested this hypothesis. To address this question, we experimentally tested the effect of biofluorescence on predation through the study of the Cope's Gray Treefrog, Hyla chrysoscelis. First, we quantified the spectral characteristics of a novel biofluorescence pattern in H. chrysoscelis. In both sexes of this species, the fluorescent signal is concentrated in an area that contains a proposed aposematic pattern to warn predators of the frog's toxic secretions. We hypothesized that the biofluorescent trait may increase the conspicuousness of this pattern and enable the frogs to deter predators more effectively. Second, we tested this prediction by conducting a clay model field experiment to assess differences in predation attempts on fluorescent versus non-fluorescent H. chrysoscelis models by various predator types. We found no effect of biofluorescence on the overall presence, type, or location of predation, suggesting that biofluorescence alone does not act as an antipredator signal of H. chrysoscelis. This study represents one of the first attempts to experimentally test the effect of biofluorescence on predation in any organism and the first to do so in amphibians. Further work is needed to explore the role of this trait in predation in other systems and to investigate alternative functions for the biofluorescent signal in H. chrysoscelis.},

  abstract = {Although biologists have described biofluorescence in a diversity of taxa, there have been few systematic efforts to document the extent of biofluorescence within a taxonomic group or investigate its general significance. Through a field survey across South America, we discover and document patterns of biofluorescence in tropical amphibians. We more than triple the number of anuran species that have been tested for this trait. We find evidence for ecological tuning (i.e., the specific adaptation of a signal to the environment in which it is received) of the biofluorescent signals. For 56.58\% of species tested, the fluorescence excitation peak matches the wavelengths most abundant at twilight, the light environment in which most frogs are active. Additionally, biofluorescence emission spans both wavelengths of low availability in twilight and the peak sensitivity of green-sensitive rods in the anuran eye, likely increasing contrast of this signal for a conspecific receiver. We propose an expanded key for testing the ecological significance of biofluorescence in future studies, providing potential explanations for the other half of fluorescent signals not originally meeting formerly proposed criteria. With evidence of tuning to the ecology and sensory systems of frogs, our results suggest frog biofluorescence is likely functioning in anuran communication.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Animal colouration is a trade-off between being seen by intended, intra- or inter-specific receivers while not being seen by the unintended. Many fishes solve this problem by adaptive colouration. Here, we investigate whether this also holds for fluorescent pigments. In those aquatic environments in which the ambient light is dominated by bluish light, red fluorescence can generate high-contrast signals. The marine, cryptic fish Tripterygion delaisi inhabits such environments and has a bright red-fluorescent iris that can be rapidly up- and down-regulated. Here, we described the physiological and cellular mechanism of this phenomenon using a neurostimulation treatment with KCl and histology. Results: KCl-treatment revealed that eye fluorescence regulation is achieved through dispersal and aggregation of black-pigmented melanosomes within melanophores. Histology showed that globular, fluorescent iridophores on the anterior side of the iris are grouped and each group is encased by finger-like extensions of a single posterior melanophore. Together they form a so-called chromatophore unit. By dispersal and aggregation of melanosomes into and out of the peripheral membranous extensions of the melanophore, the fluorescent iridophores are covered or revealed on the anterior (outside) of the iris. Conclusion: T. delaisi possesses a well-developed mechanism to control the fluorescent emission from its eyes, which may be advantageous given its cryptic lifestyle. This is the first time chromatophore units are found to control fluorescent emission in marine teleost fishes. We expect other fluorescent fish species to use similar mechanisms in the iris or elsewhere in the body. In contrast to a previously described mechanism based on dendritic fluorescent chromatophores, chromatophore units control fluorescent emission through the cooperation between two chromatophore types: an emitting and an occluding type. The discovery of a second mechanism for fluorescence modulation strengthens our view that fluorescence is a relevant and adaptive component of fish colouration.},
