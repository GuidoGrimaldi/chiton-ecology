  abstract = {Despite the great interest in characterizing the functional structure and resilience of functional groups in natural communities, few studies have examined in which way the roles and relationships of coexisting species change during community succession, a fundamental and natural process that follows the release of new resources in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Variation in algal traits that characterize different phases and stages of community succession on rocky shores are likely to influence the magnitude, direction of effects, and the level of redundancy and complementarity in the diverse assemblage of herbivores. Two separate field experiments were conducted to quantify per capita and population effects and the functional relationship (i.e., redundancy or complementarity) of four herbivore species found in central Chile during early and late algal succession. The first experiment examined grazer effects on the colonization and establishment of early-succession algal species. The second experiment examined effects on the late-successional, dominant corticated alga Mazzaella laminarioides. Complementary laboratory experiments with all species and under natural environmental conditions allowed us to further characterize the collective effects of these species. We found that, during early community succession, all herbivore species had similar effects on the ephemeral algae, ulvoids, but only during the phase of colonization. Once these algae were established, only a subset of the species was able to control their abundance. During late succession, only the keyhole limpet Fissurella crassa could control corticated Mazzaella. The functional relationships among these species changed dramatically from redundant effects on ephemeral algae during early colonization, to a more complementary role on established early-successional algae, to a dominant (i.e., keystone) effect on late succession. This study highlights that functional relationship within consumer assemblages can vary at different phases and times of community succession. Differentiation in herbivore roles emphasizes the need to evaluate consumer's impacts through different times of community succession, and through experimental manipulations to make even broad predictions about the resilience or vulnerability of diverse intertidal assemblages to human disturbances.},

  abstract = {Reef-building corals thrive in nutrient-poor marine environments because of an obligate symbiosis with photosynthetic dinoflagellates of the genus               Symbiodinium               . Symbiosis is established in most corals through the uptake of               Symbiodinium               from the environment. Corals are sessile for most of their life history, whereas free-living               Symbiodinium               are motile; hence, a mechanism to attract               Symbiodinium               would greatly increase the probability of encounter between host and symbiont. Here, we examined whether corals can attract free-living motile               Symbiodinium               by their green fluorescence, emitted by the excitation of endogenous GFP by purple-blue light. We found that               Symbiodinium               have positive and negative phototaxis toward weak green and strong purple-blue light, respectively. Under light conditions that cause corals to emit green fluorescence, (e.g., strong blue light),               Symbiodinium               were attracted toward live coral fragments.               Symbiodinium               were also attracted toward an artificial green fluorescence dye with similar excitation and emission spectra to coral-GFP. In the field, more               Symbiodinium               were found in traps painted with a green fluorescence dye than in controls. Our results revealed a biological signaling mechanism between the coral host and its potential symbionts.},

  abstract = {The environment contains different forms of ecological noise that can reduce the ability of animals to detect information. Here, we ask whether animals adapt their behavior to either exploit or avoid areas of their environment with increased dynamic visual noise. Three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were immersed in environments with a simulated form of naturally occurring visual noise---moving light bands that form on underwater substrates caused by the refraction of light through surface waves. We tested whether this form of visual noise affected fish's habitat selection, movements, and prey-targeting behavior. Fish avoided areas of the environment with increased visual noise and achieved this by increasing their activity as a function of the locally perceived noise level. Fish were less likely to respond to virtual prey in environments with increased visual noise, highlighting a potential impact that visual noise has on their perceptual abilities. Fish did not increase or decrease their refuge use in environments with increased visual noise, providing no evidence that visual noise increased either exploratory or risk-aversive behavior. Our results indicate that animals can use simple behavioral strategies to avoid visually noisy environments, thereby mitigating the impacts that these environments appear to have on their perceptual abilities.},

  abstract = {The light environment in water bodies changes with depth due to the absorption of short and long wavelengths. Below 10\,m depth, red wavelengths are almost completely absent rendering any red-reflecting animal dark and achromatic. However, fluorescence may produce red coloration even when red light is not available for reflection. A large number of marine taxa including over 270 fish species are known to produce red fluorescence, yet it is unclear under which natural light environment fluorescence contributes perceptively to their colours. To address this question we: (i) characterized the visual system of               Tripterygion delaisi,               which possesses fluorescent irides, (ii) separated the colour of the irides into its reflectance and fluorescence components and (iii) combined these data with field measurements of the ambient light environment to calculate depth-dependent perceptual chromatic and achromatic contrasts using visual modelling. We found that triplefins have cones with at least three different spectral sensitivities, including differences between the two members of the double cones, giving them the potential for trichromatic colour vision. We also show that fluorescence contributes increasingly to the radiance of the irides with increasing depth. Our results support the potential functionality of red fluorescence, including communicative roles such as species and sex identity, and non-communicative roles such as camouflage.},

New observations over the past decade have significantly increased our understanding of the diversity and multifunctionality of fluorescence in fish lineages. In this study, we present a comprehensive account of all known biofluorescent teleosts and estimate the timing and frequency of the evolution of biofluorescence across this diverse group. We show that biofluorescence evolved numerous times in marine teleosts and is estimated to date back {\textasciitilde}112 mya in Anguilliformes (true eels). Of the 459 known biofluorescent teleosts reported in this study, the majority are associated with coral reefs. We find that reef-associated species evolve biofluorescence at 10x the rate of non-reef species. Our results suggest that the chromatic and biotic conditions of coral reefs could have provided an ideal environment to facilitate the evolution and diversification of biofluorescence in teleost fishes.},

  abstract = {The marine mollusc Acanthopleura granulata (Mollusca; Polyplacophora) has a distributed visual array composed of hundreds of small image-forming eyes embedded within its eight dorsal shell plates. As in other animals with distributed visual systems, we still have a poor understanding of the visual capabilities of A. granulata and we have yet to learn where and how it processes visual information. Using behavioral trials involving isoluminant looming visual stimuli, we found that A. granulata demonstrates spatial vision with an angular resolution of 6 deg. We also found that A. granulata responds to looming stimuli defined by contrasting angles of linear polarization. To learn where and how A. granulata processes visual information, we traced optic nerves using fluorescent lipophilic dyes. We found that the optic nerves innervate the underlying lateral neuropil, a neural tissue layer that circumnavigates the body. Adjacent optic nerves innervate the lateral neuropil with highly overlapping arborizations, suggesting it is the site of an integrated visuotopic map. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that the lateral neuropil of A. granulata is subdivided into two separate layers. In comparison, we found that a chiton with eyespots (Chiton tuberculatus) and two eyeless chitons (Ischnochiton papillosus and Chaetopleura apiculata) have lateral neuropil that is a singular circular layer without subdivision, findings consistent with previous work on chiton neuroanatomy. Overall, our results suggest that A. granulata effectuates its visually mediated behaviors using a unique processing scheme: it extracts spatial and polarization information using a distributed visual system, and then integrates and processes that information using decentralized neural circuits.},

Fluorescence has the potential to contribute to the totality of light leaving an organism's surface and will therefore circumscribe how an individual could be detected and discriminated by their visual predators. Here, we: (i) documented the first record of biofluorescence on polyplacophorans, (ii) spectrally characterized the biofluorescence on shells of living chitons, (iii) measured the colour patch pattern variation, (iv) separated the colour of their shells into their reflectance and fluorescence components, and (v) combined these data with field measurements to calculate perceptual distance in chromatic and achromatic contrasts based on the visual system of their major visually guided predators. We found a red biofluorescence that enhances the brightness of chiton shells, along with a correlation showing that as individuals grow larger, the fluorescing surface area becomes smaller. Our visual models suggest that fluorescence decreases the achromatic contrast of chitons against their naturally fluorescent substrates for most visual predators, making them less noticeable to specific predators. Our results support the potential visual functionality of biofluorescence and open new hypotheses regarding its ecological roles to further investigations.},

  abstract = {Although proteins in the green fluorescent protein family (GFPs) have been discovered in a wide array of taxa, their ecological functions in these organisms remain unclear. Many hypothesized roles are related to modifying bioluminescence spectra or modulating the light regime for algal symbionts, but these do not explain the presence of GFPs in animals that are non-luminous and non-symbiotic. Other hypothesized functions are unrelated to the visual signals themselves, including stress responses and antioxidant roles, but these cannot explain the localization of fluorescence in particular structures on the animals. Here we tested the hypothesis that fluorescence might serve to attract prey. In laboratory experiments, the predator was the hydromedusa Olindias formosus ( previously known as O. formosa), which has fluorescent and pigmented patches on the tips of its tentacles. The prey, juvenile rockfishes in the genus Sebastes, were significantly more attracted (P{$<$}1{\texttimes}10-5) to the medusa's tentacles under lighting conditions where fluorescence was excited and tentacle tips were visible above the background. The fish did not respond significantly when treatments did not include fluorescent structures or took place under yellow or white lights, which did not generate fluorescence visible above the ambient light. Furthermore, underwater observations of the behavior of fishes when presented with a brightly illuminated point showed a strong attraction to this visual stimulus. In situ observations also provided evidence for fluorescent lures as supernormal stimuli in several other marine animals, including the siphonophore Rhizophysa eysenhardti. Our results support the idea that fluorescent structures can serve as prey attractants, thus providing a potential function for GFPs and other fluorescent proteins in a diverse range of organisms.},

  abstract = {Background:{\enspace} Natural red fluorescence is particularly conspicuous in the eyes of some small, benthic, predatory fishes. Fluorescence also increases in relative efficiency with increasing depth, which has generated speculation about its possible function as a ``light organ'' to detect cryptic organisms under bluish light. Here we investigate whether foraging success is improved under ambient conditions that make red fluorescence stand out more, using the triplefin Tripterygion delaisi as a model system. We repeatedly presented 10 copepods to individual fish (n = 40) kept under a narrow blue-green spectrum and compared their performance with that under a broad spectrum with the same overall brightness. The experiment was repeated for two levels of brightness, a shaded one representing 0.4\% of the light present at the surface and a heavily shaded one with about 0.01\% of the surface brightness. Results:{\enspace} Fish were 7\% more successful at catching copepods under the narrow, fluorescence-friendly spectrum than under the broad spectrum. However, this effect was significant under the heavily shaded light treatment only. Conclusions:{\enspace} This outcome corroborates previous predictions that fluorescence may be an adaptation to bluegreen, heavily shaded environments, which coincides with the opportunistic biology of this species that lives in the transition zone between exposed and heavily shaded microhabitats.},

The highest values were obtained for the ovaries of O. thyrsoides ({$\Phi$}f=0.030) and for Citrus aurantium petals ({$\Phi$}f=0.014) and stigma ({$\Phi$}f=0.013). Emitted photons as fluorescence were compared with reflected photons. It was concluded that the fluorescence emission is negligible compared to the reflected light, even for the most fluorescent samples, and it may not be considered as an optical signal in biocommunication. The work was complemented with the calculation of quantum catches for each studied flower species to describe the visual sensitization of eye photoreceptors.},

Very few studies, however, have as yet been able to demonstrate that red fluorescent fish can actually perceive their own fluorescence. This is the first study to our knowledge in which a red fluorescent fish is trained to assess whether it can recognize red fluorescence. We used the triplefin Tripterygion delaisi, a species with conspicuous red fluorescent eye rings. Training and testing involved repeated binary choices between grey and red fluorescence cues. The training and testing were carried out under broad spectral illumination. The final testing phase involved cyan light illumination, mimicking natural ambient light at depth. When testing all nine combinations of three grey brightness levels against three red fluorescence brightness levels, individuals made significantly more correct choices than the random expectation under broad as well as cyan illumination. Under cyan illumination, fish trained on red chose the correct cue more often compared to fish trained on grey. An analysis of the effect of the brightness levels suggests that fish did indeed make their choices based on chromatic more than achromatic cues: The three grey levels did not affect the proportion of correct choices. We conclude that T. delaisi can perceive and respond to levels of fluorescence that are similar to its own. We also discuss the difficulties that can arise from using a binary choice design on a fish with a cryptobenthic lifestyle. We argue in favour of using sequential choice designs in future studies of T. delaisi.},

  abstract = {To better understand relationships between the structures and functions of the distributed visual systems of chitons, we compare how morphological differences between the light-sensing structures of these animals relate to their visually guided behaviors. All chitons have sensory organs -- termed aesthetes -- embedded within their protective shell plates. In some species, the aesthetes are interspersed with small, image-forming eyes. In other species, the aesthetes are paired with pigmented eyespots. Previously, we compared the visually influenced behaviors of chitons with aesthetes to those of chitons with both aesthetes and eyes. Here, we characterize the visually influenced behaviors of chitons with aesthetes and eyespots. We find that chitons with eyespots engage in behaviors consistent with spatial vision, but appear to use spatial vision for different tasks than chitons with eyes. Unlike chitons with eyes, Chiton tuberculatus and C. marmoratus fail to distinguish between sudden appearances of overhead objects and equivalent, uniform changes in light levels. We also find that C. tuberculatus orients to static objects with angular sizes as small as 10 deg. Thus, C. tuberculatus demonstrates spatial resolution that is at least as fine as that demonstrated by chitons with eyes. The eyespots of Chiton are smaller and more numerous than the eyes found in other chitons and they are separated by angles of {$<$}0.5 deg, suggesting that the light-influenced behaviors of Chiton may be more accurately predicted by the network properties of their distributed visual system than by the structural properties of their individual light-detecting organs.},

So far, the best-known attractants in carnivorous prey traps are nectar, colour and olfactory cues. Here, fresh prey traps of 14 Nepenthes, five Sarracenia, five Drosera, two Pinguicula species/ hybrids, Dionaea muscipula and Utricularia stellaris were scanned at UV 366 nm. Fluorescence emissions of major isolates of fresh Nepenthes khasiana pitcher peristomes were recorded at an excitation wavelength of 366 nm. N. khasiana field pitcher peristomes were masked by its slippery zone extract, and prey capture rates were compared with control pitchers. We found the existence of distinct blue fluorescence emissions at the capture spots of Nepenthes, Sarracenia and Dionaea prey traps at UV 366 nm. These alluring blue emissions gradually developed with the growth of the prey traps and diminished towards their death. On excitation at 366 nm, N. khasiana peristome 3:1 CHCl3--MeOH extract and its two major blue bands showed strong fluorescence emissions at 430--480 nm. Masking of blue emissions on peristomes drastically reduced prey capture in N. khasiana pitchers. We propose these molecular emissions as a critical factor attracting arthropods and other visitors to these carnivorous traps. Drosera, Pinguicula and Utricularia prey traps showed only red chlorophyll emissions at 366 nm.},

One such example is the biomineralized armor of the chiton Acanthopleura granulata, which incorporates an integrated sensory system that includes hundreds of eyes with aragonite-based lenses. We use optical experiments to demonstrate that these microscopic lenses are able to form images. Light scattering by the polycrystalline lenses is minimized by the use of relatively large, crystallographically-aligned grains. Multi-scale mechanical testing reveals that as the size, complexity, and functionality of the integrated sensory elements increases, the local mechanical performance of the armor decreases. However, A. granulata has evolved several strategies to compensate for its mechanical vulnerabilities to form a multi-purpose system with cooptimized optical and structural functions.},

  abstract = {The intimate association between a selective herbivore (the chiton Choneplax lata) and its primary prey (the crustose coralline alga Porolithon pachydermum) results in increased biomass and accretion of the alga. This process, over ecological and geological time scales, comprises a major component of Caribbean reef-building systems. Manipulative experiments showed that as the chiton grazes the alga it stimulates new meristematic activity and removes sporlings of the competitively superior frondose and filamentous algae, thereby increasing the survival rate of P. pachydermum on the intertidal reef crest. Furthermore, in the absence of C. lata, overgrowths of frondose and filamentous epiphytes provide an attractive food source for parrotfishes (Scaridae), which accelerates bioerosion of the coralline reef-crest structure due to the deep rasping action of feeding activity. Algal removal experiments suggest that the role of P. pachydermum is to provide a predictable food source and refuge substratum, which increases survivorship of the burrowing chiton by minimizing expenditure of energy during foraging and risk to predation. The chiton/coralline alga association is abundant throughout tropical western Atlantic islands and augments reef-building processes on the shallow algal crest portion of Caribbean reefs. Cover of the Choneplax/Porolithon association in the Belize Barrier Reef crest averages 13\% (maximum to 70\%) with a mean chiton density of 664 individuals/m2 within the association. On average, the extensive networks of interconnected chiton burrows extend between 6 and 10 cm deep and contain one C. lata for every six openings, with the majority of animals (66\%) ranging from 16 to 30 mm in length. Gut contents of the chiton consist predominantly of P. pachydermum (51\%), followed by bacterial detritus (30\%), Cyanophyta (13\%), Bacillariophyta (3\%), and fleshy microalgae (3\%). The close SEM (scanning electron microscope) match between radular morphology of C. lata and grazing scars on the thallus surface of P. pachydermum shows how the chiton regularly feeds on the coralline alga without causing mortality. Virtually all P. pachydermum in the vicinity of C. lata burrows contain radular track scars of 10 JImin depth, whereas the photosynthetic, meristematic, and reproductive tissues of the coralline lie below 20 KIm.P. pachydermum under intense chiton grazing is photosynthetically competent with 0.1 mg C fixed {$\cdot$} g-{\textasciitilde} organic dry mass-h-1, which is not significantly different from ungrazed material and within the range of rates for other crustose coralline algae. The result is continuous net accretion at a mean rate of 2.3 mm/yr.},

Unlike vertebrate animals with flexibility, it is challenging for ancient animals that are less flexible especially for mollusca with heavy shells. Chiton, as an example, has eight overlapping shells covering almost the whole body, is known to incorporate sensory units called aesthetes inside the shell. We used micro-computed tomography combined with quantitative image analysis to reveal the optimized shell geometry to resist force and the aesthetes' global distribution at the whole animal levels to facilitate sense from diverse directions both in the seawater and air. Additionally, shell proteomics combined with transcriptome reveals shell matrix proteins responsible for shell construction and potentially sensory function, highlighting unique cadherin-related proteins among mollusca. Together, this multi-level evidence of sensory units in the chiton shell may shed light on the formation of chiton shells and inspire the design of hard armor with sensory function.},

In some cases square-edged blocks are used that are shaped much differently than the ovoid or `round' boulders often occurring naturally. Here it was tested if the shape of boulders affects the distribution across the boulder surface of crustose coralline algae (CCA), a taxon that strongly influences ecological dynamics in this habitat. The distance that CCA extends from the edge of boulders toward the centre of the underside was measured, and it was found that CCA extended further underneath boulders that were round-shaped compared with those that were block-shaped, probably because of light reaching further underneath round boulders. This result shows how at least one important taxon can be affected by variation in the shape of these boulders. Hypotheses being tested that use artificial substrata to model naturally occurring boulders should be carried out only in places where the artificial and naturally occurring boulders match physically.},

In this review, we summarize recent findings in the evolutionary history and ecological functions of fluorescent proteins (FP) and pigments. Evidence for green fluorescent protein (GFP) orthologs in cephalochordates and non-GFP fluorescent proteins in vertebrates suggests unexplored evolutionary scenarios that favor multiple independent origins of fluorescence across metazoan lineages. Several context-dependent behavioral and physiological roles have been attributed to fluorescent proteins, ranging from communication and predation to UV protection. However, rigorous functional and mechanistic studies are needed to shed light on the ecological functions and control mechanisms of fluorescence.},

  abstract = {Fluorescence is a physico-chemical energy exchange where shorter-wavelength photons are absorbed by a molecule and are re-emitted as longer-wavelength photons. It has been suggested a means of communication in several taxa including flowers, pitcher plants, corals, algae, worms, squid, spiders, stomatopods, fish, reptiles, parrots and humans. The surface or object that the pigment molecule is part of appears to glow due to its setting rather than an actual production of light, and this may enhance both signals and, in some cases, camouflage. This review examines some known uses of fluorescence, mainly in the context of visual communication in animals, the challenge being to distinguish when fluorescence is a functional feature of biological coloration or when it is a by-product of a pigment or other molecule. In general, we conclude that most observations of fluorescence lack enough evidence to suggest they are used in visually driven behaviours.

For example, against a static background movement is highly conspicuous, which favours staying still to optimize camouflage. However, backgrounds can also be highly dynamic, such as areas with wind-blown foliage or frequent changes in illumination. We propose that these dynamic features act as visual noise which could serve to mask otherwise conspicuous movement. Two forms of illumination change were simulated, water caustics and dappled light, to represent dynamic aquatic and terrestrial environments, respectively. When asked to capture moving prey items within the simulated scenes, human participants were significantly slower and more error prone when viewing scenes with dynamic illumination. This effect was near identical for both the aquatic and terrestrial environments. In the latter, prey item movement was also found to be masked most often when the pathway taken involved movement across the dynamic dappled areas of the scene. This could allow particularly moving prey to reduce their signal-to-noise ratio by behaviourally favouring the relative safety of environments containing dynamic features.},

  abstract = {Gregarious settlement, an essential behavior for many barnacle species that can only reproduce by mating with a nearby barnacle, has long been thought to rely on larval ability to recognize chemical signals from conspecifics during settlement. However, the cyprid, the settlement stage larva in barnacles, has one pair of compound eyes that appear only at the late nauplius VI and cyprid stages, but the function(s) of these eyes remains unknown. Here we show that cyprids of the intertidal barnacle Balanus (=Amphibalanus) amphitrite can locate adult barnacles even in the absence of chemical cues, and prefer to settle around them probably via larval sense of vision. We also show that the cyprids can discriminate color and preferred to settle on red surfaces. Moreover, we found that shells of adult B. amphitrite emit red auto-fluorescence and the adult extracts with the fluorescence as a visual signal attracted cyprid larvae to settle around it. We propose that the perception of specific visual signals can be involved in behavior of zooplankton including marine invertebrate larvae, and that barnacle auto-fluorescence may be a specific signal involved in gregarious larval settlement.},

Some GFP-like proteins, most notably fluorescent greens and nonfluorescent chromoproteins, indeed generate intense color signals. An unexpected finding was that fluorescent proteins might also make corals appear less colorful to fish, counterbalancing the effect of absorption by the photosynthetic pigments of the endosymbiotic algae, which might be a form of protection against herbivores. We conclude that GFP-determined coloration of corals may be an important factor in visual ecology of the reef fishes.},

In this study, we contrast two non-exclusive hypotheses: (i) that UV absorption by fluorescent pigments offers significant photoprotection in shallow water, where UV irradiance is strongest; and (ii) that red fluorescence enhances visual contrast at depths below --- 10 m, where most light in the 'red' 600-700 run range has been absorbed. Whereas the photoprotection hypothesis predicts fluorescence to be stronger near the surface and weaker in deeper water, the visual contrast hypothesis predicts the opposite. We used fluorometry to measure red fluorescence brightness in vivo in individuals belonging to eight common small reef fish species with conspicuously red fluorescent eyes. Fluorescence was significantly brighter in specimens from the -20 m sites than in those from --- 5m sites in six out of eight species. No difference was found in the remaining two. Our results support the visual contrast hypothesis. We discuss the possible roles fluorescence may play in fish visual ecology and highlight the possibility that fluorescent light emission from the eyes in particular may be used to detect cryptic prey.]},

Bright irides in diurnal fish species have recently been proposed as a potential analogue. Here, we contribute to this discussion by testing whether iris radiance is actively modulated. The focus is on behaviourally controlled iris reflections, called `ocular sparks'. The triplefin Tripterygion delaisi can alternate between red and blue ocular sparks, allowing us to test the prediction that spark frequency and hue depend on background hue and prey presence. In a first experiment, we found that blue ocular sparks were significantly more often `on' against red backgrounds, and red ocular sparks against blue backgrounds, particularly when copepods were present. A second experiment tested whether hungry fish showed more ocular sparks, which was not the case. However, background hue once more resulted in a significant differential use of ocular sparks. We conclude that iris radiance through ocular sparks in T. delaisi is not a side effect of eye movement, but adaptively modulated in response to the context under which prey are detected. We discuss the possible alternative functions of ocular sparks, including an as yet speculative role in active photolocation.},

  abstract = {The visual environment provides vital cues allowing animals to assess habitat quality, weather conditions or measure time of day. Together with other sensory cues and physiological conditions, the visual environment sets behavioral states that make the animal more prone to engage in some behaviors, and less in others. This master-control of behavior serves a fundamental and essential role in determining the distribution and behavior of all animals. Although it is obvious that visual information contains vital input for setting behavioral states, the precise nature of these visual cues remains unknown. Here we use a recently described method to quantify the distribution of light reaching animals' eyes in different environments. The method records the vertical gradient (as a function of elevation angle) of intensity, spatial structure and spectral balance. Comparison of measurements from different types of environments, weather conditions, times of day, and seasons reveal that these aspects can be readily discriminated from one another. The vertical gradients of radiance, spatial structure (contrast) and color are thus reliable indicators that are likely to have a strong impact on animal behavior and spatial distribution.},

The Cambrian stage of molluscan evolution is characterized based on the paleontological material. The doubtfulness of assignment of the Precambrian (Vendian) soft-bodied fossil Kimberella to mollusks is argued. Judging from the interpretation of the morphologically diverse Cambrian fossils, it is suggested that the classes Polyplacophora, Monoplacophora, Gastropoda and Bivalvia formed already near the Precambrian--Cambrian boundary, i.e., from the beginning of the paleontologically documented evolutionary history of the phylum, whereas the assumption of the later origin of these taxa is unconvincing. The remaining classes of mollusks arose later, i.e., Cephalopoda, in the Late Cambrian; Scaphopoda, in the Ordovician; and Aplacophora, in the Silurian.},

  abstract = {Biofluorescence is widespread in the natural world, but only recently discovered in terrestrial vertebrates. Here, we report on the discovery of iridophore-based, neon-green flourescence in the gecko Pachydactylus rangei, localised to the skin around the eyes and along the flanks. The maximum emission of the fluorescence is at a wavelength of 516~nm in the green spectrum (excitation maximum 465~nm, blue) with another, smaller peak at 430~nm. The fluorescent regions of the skin show large numbers of iridophores, which are lacking in the non-fluorescent parts. Two types of iridophores are recognized, fluorescent iridophores and basal, non-fluorescent iridophores, the latter of which might function as a mirror, amplifying the omnidirectional fluorescence. The strong intensity of the fluorescence (quantum yield of 12.5\%) indicates this to be a highly effective mechanism, unique among tetrapods. Although the fluorescence is associated with iridophores, the spectra of emission and excitation as well as the small Stokes shifts argue against guanine crystals as its source, but rather a rigid pair of fluorophores. Further studies are necessary to identify their morphology and chemical structures. We hypothesise that this nocturnal gecko uses the neon-green fluorescence, excited by moonlight, for intraspecific signalling in its open desert habitat.},

Whereas the majority of fluorescent proteins have been identified from cnidarians, recently several fluorescent proteins have been isolated across the animal tree of life. Here we show that biofluorescence is not only phylogenetically widespread, but is also phenotypically variable across both cartilaginous and bony fishes, highlighting its evolutionary history and the possibility for discovery of numerous novel fluorescent proteins. Fish biofluorescence is especially common and morphologically variable in cryptically patterned coralreef lineages. We identified 16 orders, 50 families, 105 genera, and more than 180 species of biofluorescent fishes. We have also reconstructed our current understanding of the phylogenetic distribution of biofluorescence for ray-finned fishes. The presence of yellow long-pass intraocular filters in many biofluorescent fish lineages and the substantive color vision capabilities of coral-reef fishes suggest that they are capable of detecting fluoresced light. We present species-specific emission patterns among closely related species, indicating that biofluorescence potentially functions in intraspecific communication and evidence that fluorescence can be used for camouflage. This research provides insight into the distribution, evolution, and phenotypic variability of biofluorescence in marine lineages and examines the role this variation may play.},

These ocelli each contain a pigment layer, retina, and lens [2], but it is unknown whether they provide chitons with spatial vision [3]. It is also unclear whether chiton lenses are made from proteins, like nearly all biological lenses, or from some other material [4]. Electron probe X-ray microanalysis and X-ray diffraction revealed that the chiton Acanthopleura granulata has the first aragonite lenses ever discovered. We found that these lenses allow A. granulata's ocelli to function as small camera eyes with an angular resolution of about 9 --12 . Animals responded to the sudden appearance of black, overhead circles with an angular size of 9 , but not to equivalent, uniform decreases in the downwelling irradiance. Our behavioral estimates of angular resolution were consistent with estimates derived from focal length and receptor spacing within the A. granulata eye. Behavioral trials further indicated that A. granulata's eyes provide the same angular resolution in both air and water. We propose that one of the two refractive indices of the birefringent chiton lens places a focused image on the retina in air, whereas the other does so in water.},

Our aim was to better characterize the vision and visual ecology of this unusual visual system. We tested animal orientation relative to vertical bar stimuli at a range of angular widths and contrasts, to identify limits of angular and contrast detection. We also presented dynamic shadow stimuli, either looming towards or passing the animal overhead, to test for potential defensive responses. Finally, we presented animals lacking a single arm with a vertical bar stimulus known to elicit a response in intact animals. We found that O. wendtii orients to large ({$\geq$}50\>deg), high-contrast vertical bar stimuli, consistent with a shelter-seeking role and with photoreceptor acceptance angles estimated from morphology. We calculate poor optical sensitivity for individual photoreceptors, and predict dramatic oversampling for photoreceptor arrays. We also report responses to dark stimuli moving against a bright background -- this is the first report of responses to moving stimuli in brittle stars and suggests additional defensive uses for vision in echinoderms. Finally, we found that animals missing a single arm orient less well to static stimuli, which requires further investigation.},

Over half of the studies documenting biofluorescence in the last century suggest this fluorescent signal may affect predation; however, to date, only one other experimental study has tested this hypothesis. To address this question, we experimentally tested the effect of biofluorescence on predation through the study of the Cope's Gray Treefrog, Hyla chrysoscelis. First, we quantified the spectral characteristics of a novel biofluorescence pattern in H. chrysoscelis. In both sexes of this species, the fluorescent signal is concentrated in an area that contains a proposed aposematic pattern to warn predators of the frog's toxic secretions. We hypothesized that the biofluorescent trait may increase the conspicuousness of this pattern and enable the frogs to deter predators more effectively. Second, we tested this prediction by conducting a clay model field experiment to assess differences in predation attempts on fluorescent versus non-fluorescent H. chrysoscelis models by various predator types. We found no effect of biofluorescence on the overall presence, type, or location of predation, suggesting that biofluorescence alone does not act as an antipredator signal of H. chrysoscelis. This study represents one of the first attempts to experimentally test the effect of biofluorescence on predation in any organism and the first to do so in amphibians. Further work is needed to explore the role of this trait in predation in other systems and to investigate alternative functions for the biofluorescent signal in H. chrysoscelis.},

  abstract = {Although biologists have described biofluorescence in a diversity of taxa, there have been few systematic efforts to document the extent of biofluorescence within a taxonomic group or investigate its general significance. Through a field survey across South America, we discover and document patterns of biofluorescence in tropical amphibians. We more than triple the number of anuran species that have been tested for this trait. We find evidence for ecological tuning (i.e., the specific adaptation of a signal to the environment in which it is received) of the biofluorescent signals. For 56.58\% of species tested, the fluorescence excitation peak matches the wavelengths most abundant at twilight, the light environment in which most frogs are active. Additionally, biofluorescence emission spans both wavelengths of low availability in twilight and the peak sensitivity of green-sensitive rods in the anuran eye, likely increasing contrast of this signal for a conspecific receiver. We propose an expanded key for testing the ecological significance of biofluorescence in future studies, providing potential explanations for the other half of fluorescent signals not originally meeting formerly proposed criteria. With evidence of tuning to the ecology and sensory systems of frogs, our results suggest frog biofluorescence is likely functioning in anuran communication.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Animal colouration is a trade-off between being seen by intended, intra- or inter-specific receivers while not being seen by the unintended. Many fishes solve this problem by adaptive colouration. Here, we investigate whether this also holds for fluorescent pigments. In those aquatic environments in which the ambient light is dominated by bluish light, red fluorescence can generate high-contrast signals. The marine, cryptic fish Tripterygion delaisi inhabits such environments and has a bright red-fluorescent iris that can be rapidly up- and down-regulated. Here, we described the physiological and cellular mechanism of this phenomenon using a neurostimulation treatment with KCl and histology. Results: KCl-treatment revealed that eye fluorescence regulation is achieved through dispersal and aggregation of black-pigmented melanosomes within melanophores. Histology showed that globular, fluorescent iridophores on the anterior side of the iris are grouped and each group is encased by finger-like extensions of a single posterior melanophore. Together they form a so-called chromatophore unit. By dispersal and aggregation of melanosomes into and out of the peripheral membranous extensions of the melanophore, the fluorescent iridophores are covered or revealed on the anterior (outside) of the iris. Conclusion: T. delaisi possesses a well-developed mechanism to control the fluorescent emission from its eyes, which may be advantageous given its cryptic lifestyle. This is the first time chromatophore units are found to control fluorescent emission in marine teleost fishes. We expect other fluorescent fish species to use similar mechanisms in the iris or elsewhere in the body. In contrast to a previously described mechanism based on dendritic fluorescent chromatophores, chromatophore units control fluorescent emission through the cooperation between two chromatophore types: an emitting and an occluding type. The discovery of a second mechanism for fluorescence modulation strengthens our view that fluorescence is a relevant and adaptive component of fish colouration.},
